As a member of the doc team, I'm strongly in favor of keeping the docs together and feel having the OSS content split into their respective repos would lead to a poor user experience overall. Scenario content that crosses multiple technologies, having a common IA, and keeping one place for people to submit doc updates are a few reasons that I have for keeping all of the content in one repo.

Instead of having this conversation in PR comments, I'm open to discussing this through zoom with folks, in-person at ChefConf, or in some other fashion.

We use this for specific instances where both uploadarchive.allowUnreachable and uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant are enabled on the git server.  This allows pulls/fetches using any commit id not just advertised references.  This type of un-shallowing is also used within some builds systems for similar conditions.

If it would be better to explicitly fail under this condition for the largest group of consumers then we probably shouldn’t change the behavior.  If we think it would be useful and warrants the addition or change to the attributes/actions on the resource I can certainly provide that as well.

Let me know either way what your opinion is on this.  We have this code as a stand-alone cookbook and leverage the DSL that way, so if this PR isn’t accepted it isn’t the end of the world.

> ResourceBundleConstraintDescriptionResolver's constructor will throw MissingResourceException

Did you mean `ResourceBundleConstraintDescriptionResolver` here? Its constructor doesn't do much and won't throw a `MissingResourceException` that I can see.

As things stand, when a constraint is encountered for which there is no description, `ConstraintDescriptions.descriptionsForProperty(String)` will throw an exception that identifies the constraint:

```
java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find resource for bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle, key org.hibernate.validator.constraints.time.DurationMin.description
	at java.util.ResourceBundle.getObject(ResourceBundle.java:450)
	at java.util.ResourceBundle.getString(ResourceBundle.java:407)
	at org.springframework.restdocs.constraints.ResourceBundleConstraintDescriptionResolver.getDescription(ResourceBundleConstraintDescriptionResolver.java:157)
	at org.springframework.restdocs.constraints.ResourceBundleConstraintDescriptionResolver.resolveDescription(ResourceBundleConstraintDescriptionResolver.java:144)
	at org.springframework.restdocs.constraints.ConstraintDescriptions.descriptionsForProperty(ConstraintDescriptions.java:103)
```

I think that's a good thing as it makes it clear that there's a constraint that needs to be described. 

With your proposed change, the undescribed constraint will be ignored. As a result, the documentation may fail to describe a constraint. This goes against the Spring REST Docs ethos which is to make your tests fail if your documentation is inaccurate or incomplete.

Have I misunderstood the intent of your change?"	2017-03-24 20:05:28	0.0		1
61	"My apologies, I mis-summarized the issue - the ExceptionInInitializerError is due to how I'm using Spring REST Docs, not in Spring REST Docs itself. I've updated the title and description of this issue appropriately.

Here's the stack trace:
```
java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find resource for bundle java.util.PropertyResourceBundle, key org.hibernate.validator.constraints.time.DurationMin.description
        at java.util.ResourceBundle.getObject(ResourceBundle.java:450)
        at java.util.ResourceBundle.getString(ResourceBundle.java:407)
        at org.springframework.restdocs.constraints.ResourceBundleConstraintDescriptionResolver.getDescription(ResourceBundleConstraintDescriptionResolver.java:157)
        at org.springframework.restdocs.constraints.ResourceBundleConstraintDescriptionResolver.resolveDescription(ResourceBundleConstraintDescriptionResolver.java:144)
        at org.springframework.restdocs.constraints.ConstraintDescriptions.descriptionsForProperty(ConstraintDescriptions.java:103)
        at com.example.SomeTest.withPath(SomeTest.java:30)
```

And that line from `com.example.SomeTest.withPath` is:
```
new ConstraintDescriptions(MyEntity.class).descriptionsForProperty(""duration"")
```

Where `MyEntity.duration` is defined as:
```
@org.hibernate.validator.constraints.time.DurationMin(days=7)
private Duration duration;
```

I'm using Hibernate Validator 6 to get DurationMin, which if you're using Spring Boot and Maven, can be done by adding these properties to pom.xml:
```
<hibernate-validator.version>6.0.0.Alpha1</hibernate-validator.version>
<javax-validation.version>2.0.0.Alpha1</javax-validation.version>
```

I don't think it makes sense for `org.springframework.restdocs.constraints.ConstraintDescriptions.descriptionsForProperty` to throw `MissingResourceException` - if no descriptions are found, I would (and did) expect it to return an empty list, and that's the change this PR makes."	2017-03-24 20:51:04	0.0		1

When I was looking at #261 I had something like a `CommandFormatter` in mind that would take a list of Strings, each of which should be kept on one line. The formatter could then either concatenate them with ` ` separators, with `\\%n` separators, or whatever someone wants to implement. A particular formatter could be used by default, and could be configured using `SnippetConfigurer` or by passing one into new overloaded methods on `CliDocumentation`."	2017-02-13 16:39:09	0.0		1
85	"@wilkinsona Thanks!

As for your additional remarks: I was thinking about injecting a `CommandFormatter` object to both `CurlRequestSnippet` and `HttpieRequestSnippet` and using it for printing the output. But then I realized that it's not that simple. 
Let's look at the example from the initial issue:

```
$ curl 'http://localhost/foo' -i -X POST \
   -H 'X-Header-One: ONE' \
   -H 'X-Header-Two: TWO' \
   -d 'a=alpha&b=bravo'
```

Some `curl` parameters are printed after a newline and some are not (`-i -X POST`). This means that there are actually two different separators in use here. I see two possible options for dealing with this:

1. Injecting 2 instances of `CommandFormatter` and passing parameters to one or the other
2. Constructing a `CommandFormatter` object by passing two separators to it and then maintaining both parameter lists inside it.

Option 2 seems to be better for me but I'd like to reach a decision before implementing this. What do you think?"	2017-02-16 20:08:35	0.0		0
86	"I wonder if we could keep it simple and have the curl snippet be somewhat opinionated about where line breaks could go. It could pass the following to the formatter:

- `curl 'http://localhost/foo' -i -X POST`
- `-H 'X-Header-One: ONE'`
- `-H 'X-Header-Two: TWO'`
- `-d 'a=alpha&b=bravo'`

The formatter would treat each of those 4 items as a String that should not be broken onto multiple lines. The formatter is then free to join those four strings in whatever way it deems appropriate, keeping them all on one long line, splitting it over 4 lines, etc."	2017-02-16 20:17:53	0.0		1

My motivation was that I wanted the opinion on what the default formatter should be to be in a single place. `CliDocumentation` seemed to make sense as it can then pass the default formatter into `CurlRequestSnippet` and `HttpieRequestSnippet`. 

I was also envisaging a further change where the default moves to `SnippetConfigurer` and it'll apply it to the default `CurlRequestSnippet` and `HttpieRequestSnippet` that it creates. The would lead to the deprecation of `curlRequest()` and `httpieRequest()` on `CliDocumentation` as well.

But, to have it done in a clean way I would propose the following changes:

- `CurlRequestSnippet`: create a copy of all constructors with an additional `commandFormatter` parameter and deprecate the old ones
- `CliDocumentation`: create additional `curlRequest` method that takes `attributes` and `commandFormatter` parameters. Additionally, change all existing `CurlRequestSnippet` constructors so that they will receive the default formatter.
- `CurlRequestSnippetTests`: add the additional formatter parameter to each `CurlRequestSnippet` constructor or call the appropriate `CliDocumentation` method. The former option feels better since these are the `CurlRequestSnippet` tests.

With the cookies available via a `getCookies()` method we'd have to figure out what to do with the `Set-Cookie` header. With REST Assured there'd be the same information in two places. With MockMvc, the cookies would just be available from `getCookies()` unless we explicitly set the header as well (as is being proposed here).

Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm getting more convinced that maybe it would be better to have this information structured in a more object-oriented fashion and create a `ResponseCookie` class (similar to the `RequestCookie` you've introduced).

127	REST Assured and Jersey's test client (for which there's third-party REST Docs support) both set the `Set-Cookie` header automatically. It'd be nice of MockMvc wasn't the odd one out. MockMvc is also a bit inconsistent on its own: if you use a setter to configure the content type of a request or response it automatically sets the `Content-Type` header as well. I've opened [SPR-15225](https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-15225) to see if removing that inconsistency is a possibility.

128	It looks like SPR-15225 is going to be fixed, but only in 5.0. I think that means we should proceed with setting the `Set-Cookie` header for MockMvc but only if it hasn't already been set. That should allow REST Docs to work with both Spring Framework 4.3 and 5.0.	2017-03-08 17:12:43	0.0		1

I see the need for some more flexibility, though. At the moment the snippet name is used for two purposes:

I'm not keen on `removeHeaders` taking an `Object`. I do like that it lets you mix patterns and strings, but, IMO, that's outweighed by the loss of type safety. I'd prefer to either have `removeMatchingHeaders(String pattern)` or overload `removeHeaders` with `removeHeaders(Pattern pattern)`. I'm leaning towards the former as the user doesn't have to call `Pattern.compile` and the method name makes it clear that there's some matching involved.

``` java
RestAssured.basePath = ""/{x}"";
given().pathParam(""x"", ""something"").pathParam(""y"", ""else"").when().get(""/{y}""). ..
```

The ""original bash path"" would thus be ""/{x}"" but the ""original path"" probably ought to be ""/{x}/{y}"". I.e. the base path is prepended to the path specified in ""get"". This attracts me more to put the method in `FilterContext` since the ""original path"" will be a derived value (basePath + ""get path"") just as the other values in `FilterContext` (whether or not it was a good idea to put these values in `FilterContext` in the first place is another discussion :)).

The `sourceDir` is the location from which your main Asciidoc file(s) should be read. Your change means it will only find the individual snippets. Also, all tasks have `inputs.dir`, so whatever your problem was, that wasn't the cause.

Have you perhaps put your main Asciidoc file in the wrong place? When using Gradle they should go in `src/docs/asciidoc` by default.

There have already been requests for better support for XML payloads (see #46, for example) and I'd prefer not to add to the problem of things being too JSON-centric.

How about a `ResponseFormatter` abstraction that takes the response as input and returns the formatted content? The default implementation, `IdentityResponseFormatter` would simply return the content as-is. To enable pretty-printing, or any other sort of response post-processing, users could associate a `ResponseFormatter` implementation with a particular content type, perhaps via an API on `RestDocumentationConfigurer` that sets the formatters on `RestDocumentationContext`. Jackson-based implementations for pretty-printing JSON and XML could be provided.

The above-described changes would probably mean that there's only a single snippet produced, rather than one snippet for the formatted response and one for the unformatted response. I suspect that won't be a problem, though, as I can't imagine someone wanting to use both the formatted and the unformatted snippets in the same documentation. That's only a hunch. If you have real word experience the says otherwise, please do say so.

305	"I've been thinking about this too, and I agree. We even have a need where we want to filter out headers from the response (for instance, it isn't useful documenting things like Cache-Control, Pragma or X-Frame-Options in every request). So a ResponseFormatter would be a useful abstraction where we can fine-tune exactly how headers are filtered and response bodies are formatted.

I agree that a single snippet is fine -- I was hoping to do that but because `documentHttpResponse` gets added to the list of delegates in the constructor, it is harder to fine-tune. Do you think the default set of delegates should be configurable? Or maybe this point becomes moot when we can inject our own ResponseFormatter.

Let me take another look at this and get back to you.

306	"Interesting. I hadn't considered stripping out headers. I like that idea too. Given that capability, perhaps `ResponsePostProcessor` would be more appropriate? It's no longer just about formatting.

I haven't looked in detail to confirm that this'll work, but I think that `RestDocumentationResultHandler` could call the configured response formatters/post-processors and then call its delegates. There's no setter for an `MvcResult`'s response so I think the result would have to be copied to contain the new response. There may also be some hoops to jump through to produce a response with formatted content: judicious use of `setCommitted(false)` and `resetBuffer()` should do the trick.

When the user has opted to document some fields I think it's reasonable, at least initially, for the test to pass or fail based on the same criteria as the link documentation support. If it becomes clear that this is too strict, then we can relax both at the same time.

There are only four fields that require documentation: `_links`, `id`, `name`, and `_embedded`. If you want to go into more detail on the structure of `_embedded`, then you could document `_embedded.contacts` and `_embedded.website` instead of `_embedded`. This is probably the level I'd go to, with the documentation for `_embedded.contacts` and `_embedded.website` being nothing more than a link to the documentation for the contacts and website resources respectively.

This conflicts in my opinion with:

> This is probably the level I'd go to, with the documentation for _embedded.contacts and _embedded.website being nothing more than a link to the documentation for the contacts and website resources respectively.

If I understand the link documentation criteria, all the field paths of the response should be gathered, and compared with the documentation. If the same is applied here, the test would fail in your scenario I think. It would expect _embedded.website.id or _embedded.website.url to also be documented.

Where would the recursive check draw the line? Should we have some more intelligent logic to check if one of the fields of a certain depth-level is documented, all those fields on that level should be documented?

I'm looking [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples/commits/master) for inspiration here but can't see what else I can add. Any tips?"	2016-12-19 10:28:13	0.0		0

392	"I am still not sure I can follow: we still have a `Long` identifier but the repository exposing a `String` id. That's highly unusual to the average Spring Data developer. `findOne(…)` is supposed to lookup the entity by they identifier. It looks like that's not the case here. Can you elaborate? This seems to be a very fundamental change to what developers expect in a Spring Data setup.

Regarding the commit message: if I read that and look at the change I'd get the impression that I now *need* add that indexed property to all of my domain types to make them work with SDN 4.2. Is that really the case?"	2016-12-19 11:52:19	0.0		1
393	"@olivergierke I wish we could get rid of the `Long` id but we can't at the moment (for the same reason we can't remove the default constructor). The whole `Long`/`GraphId` is a misnomer; It represents an object in a neo4j database _but_ that id may point to a completely different object or to no object at all on a restart of the database. Consequently it's an encapsulation leak from the database into the OGM and also into SDN.

So we now have the ability to work with people who don't care about database restarts (like those who use the embedded database once off) whereby they can use a repository of ID `Long` (See `GraphRepository`) and those that want to use a natural or synthetic ID which will work across database restarts that want to use a repository of type `Whatever implements Serializable`.

395	I've never been a great fan of all these store details leaking into the domain types. Is there a chance that developers could just use Spring Data's `@Id` and basically get that `@Index(unique = true, primary = true)` stuff automatically?	2016-12-19 12:09:05	0.0		0
396	What I am wondering, too: if your newly added property *is* the ID, how is the Spring Data `MappingContext` implementation actually finding out about this? There doesn't seem to be anything unique about the property as the `@Index` annotation could be used on other properties, too, right? I am wondering as e.g. Spring Data REST relies on that information to correctly map incoming requests to the actual identifier values.	2016-12-19 12:13:54	0.0		0
397	"@olivergierke RE: The idea about `@Id`. Let me run it up the flagpole and see what comes back. I've always liked the idea of `@Id` and I had that concept in the OGM I wrote.

RE: `MappingContext` it's delegated to the OGM via the `Neo4jPersistentProperty`. I have not yet refactored this part of the code to integrate more tightly with Spring Data yet through. The links I sent you above refer to Spring REST's problems with the `id` field.

I'm spread pretty thin at the moment so I'll get to updating it when I can :\

RE: This example. While we have taken some big steps to get closer to Spring Data there are still more to go. At the moment I want to encourage users to use SDN in a way that will allow us to eventually remove the `Long` (or even define it themselves if they run in a one time embedded environment).

398	"Can you clarify on a couple of things here?

- Does the repository actually need to extend a store-specific interface? We usually recommend not to do so as is exposes store details to its clients.
- You change the ID type to `UUID` but the domain class still contains a `Long` identifier? That is at least confusing but actually even looks broken."	2016-12-19 08:05:37	0.0		1
399	"1. No it doesn't. In fact until you mentioned it I actually thought it was normal to extend the store specific interface. I'll change this.
1. Argh.. This has been a problem for a while now. The OGM and SDN 3.x both expose a neo4j database implementation called `ID` which currently needs to be annotated with `@GraphId`. Unlike other DB's it's *NOT* guaranteed to be unique across database restarts ([read more here](http://blog.armbruster-it.de/2013/08/assigning-uuids-to-neo4j-nodes-and-relationships/) - it's still relevant). On top of this developers have asked to have a way of uniquely identifying their domain objects, either naturally or with the Neo4j recommended approach of using `UUID`s.  Furthermore the implications of this result in things like: https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAGRAPH-918 and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j/issues/366. Ideally this implementation detail will be hidden in future. Personally I'm hoping when we can remove default constructors we can also remove the need for exposing the internal ID. What I will do for now is add some javadoc here to make this clear for those who haven't used Neo4j before."	2016-12-19 10:18:56	0.0		1

462	"Hi @olivergierke , I have a follow up question! 

I debated using this plugin originally. The static weaving plugin listed in the EclipseLink documentation requires a persistence-unit defined in a persistence.xml. Without specifying the entity classes or a jar in the persistence-unit, it didn't actually do any weaving on the class files. The plugin in the current version of the PR does class scanning which seems more ideal, but in hindsight it's probably not ideal for an example like this because it's non standard and may stop working at some point if that non maven central plugin disappears.

I have the example working with all the other review comments incorporated so it is much more correct in terms of Spring Boot usage. I have it working using both this plugin and the standard plugin. To get the standard plugin working, I had to create a persistence.xml file and define a persistence-unit and list the entity class. The JIRA issue did state ""Ideally this would include static weaving."" So I can either resubmit with the standard plugin and the persistence.xml, or just remove the static weaving portion. Which would you be better?

Thanks!

463	"Okay, let's stick to plugin then. Is it possible to at least use a non-snapshot version of it or is the classpath scanning only available in 1.1? If in doubt, keep Boot customizations and Spring setup to a minimum and move custom setup into the build, so that we expose the infrastructure setup cost that way.

Does that make sense and provide enough guideline?
"	2015-03-18 08:47:36	0.0		1
464	"@olivergierke  , thanks again for the feedback! 

There isn't a non-snapshot version of the plugin available. As I was thinking more about this, I think the plugin from maven central and the use of a persistence.xml better illustrates the costs of using static weaving? Another approach would be to use the plugin from maven central, define a persistence.xml with only the entity information to support the static weaving during build time and then not use it for the Spring Boot application example. In this case, the persistence.xml exists just to provide the required information for the build time weaving of the entity, Spring Boot customizations are kept to a minimum and the infrastructure setup cost is all in the build. I just verified that works as well. 

The more detailed example would be using the maven central plugin and a persistence.xml and doing more Spring Boot customization to [use a traditional persistence.xm](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-data-access.html#howto-use-traditional-persistence-xml).

- we should really get rid off the need to declare default constructors (see `Conference`)

- the date time types should be Java 8's (there is a `Jsr310Converter` in Spring Data Commons)

thank you for contribution as usual! :smile: 
I wonder what do you think about Spring IO Platform compatibility https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin/issues/115.

I'm also interested in the Gradle 3.1 upgrade but that issue is really stopping me, although I don't see any problems in one my small project which is a part of Spring IO Platform and really build SUCCESSFULy with the `springIoCheck`  task when I add `classpath 'io.spring.gradle:dependency-management-plugin:0.6.1.RELEASE'` as well.

WDYT?

578	"Hey @artembilan, you're welcome! :smile:

I've been following the situation with Gradle 3 and Dependency management plugin as we (at my company) use Gradle exclusively so it's a topic of our interest. We have two medium to large projects ongoing that are on Gradle 3 (3.1 ATM to be exact) and we haven't faced any issues (both are Spring IO Platform and Boot based). Spring Security has also moved to Gradle 3 (spring-projects/spring-security#4052) some time ago. So IMO the best approach would be to attempt the Gradle upgrade and see where that gets you, since chances are good (from my experience at least) that you won't run into any issue.

Upgrade of Dependency management plugin to 0.6.x is required due to spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin#87 since Spring IO plugin is still based on 0.5.x, I assume you encountered that one in your project as well.

580	"I think I would prefer to keep the two objects decoupled, but provide an easy way to configure them. One way this could be done by determining if `SpringSessionRememberMeServices` is a Bean to set `CookieSerializer` expiration property.

Another issue we should consider is how does this behave with Spring Security's session fixation protection. In older servlet environments the session is invalidated and then recreated at log in. I cannot recall off the top of my head if this happens before or after the remember me logic is invoked.

581	"@rwinch Thanks for the feedback, I'll look into it.

> One way this could be done by determining if SpringSessionRememberMeServices is a Bean to set CookieSerializer expiration property.

But this doesn't (unless I'm missing something) address the situation described in my previous comment:

> IMO it should be possible to have behavior that is similar to one of Google Account's `SID` cookie - if `Stay signed in` option is selected, session cookie is persistent meaning it has expiration specified, otherwise it's not persistent.

We need to somehow serialize the cookie with different max age depending on whether remember-me was requested or not. Having two `CookieSerializer`s doesn't look appealing to me, maybe `CookieSerializer` interface could be extended with `writeCookieValue` method that allows specifying the `cookieMaxAge` parameter?

582	"@vpavic 

I'm not sure why this wouldn't help. If `SpringSessionRememberMeServices` was a Bean, the configuration would automatically ensure that the `CookieSerializer` was setup properly.

583	"@rwinch I've updated the PR. `SpringSessionRememberMeServices` now sets request attribute upon successful remember-me login. `DefaultCookieSerializer` can now be configured to look for the presence of remember-me request attribute and apply the appropriate cookie max age. I went with request attribute (vs request param as we originally discussed) due to the fact its more reliable way to indicate remember-me login - the request param might be present without remember-me being involved at all, which is sort of a risk.

The automatic configuration of `DefaultCookieSerializer` was somewhat tricky due to `SpringSessionRememberMeServices` relying on `spring-security-web` dependency which is optional.

628	"Hi @rwinch, thanks for the feedback!!  As I described in Issue #616, I'm running into issues in environments with multiple application servers connected to multiple databases.  At the top of the minute, both servers are kicking off the `JdbcOperationsSessionRepository#cleanUpExpiredSessions()` method to clean up sessions on their databases.  When the databases try to delete the data on the other servers through replication, it runs into errors because the data it is expecting to be there is actually not there.  This change would allow a system property to be set on each server for the Cron expression, so, for example, one server could run the `cleanUpExpiredSessions()` method at the top of every minute, and the other server could easily be set to run `cleanUpExpiredSessions()` at the 30 second point of every minute.  Sorry, I'm not the best at explaining things sometimes, so I hope this makes sense!  Let me know if you have any other questions.

```

@Bean

If possible, I think we should consider only writing the attributes that have changed. In our experience, this is somewhat critical to ensuring users get the best experience. It not only improves performance, but reduces the likelihood of race conditions which are inherent in web applications.

Correct. You can look at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/commit/34cebc3df68cf1b1ae3703575933ad34c8f5e602 as a guideline. Keep in mind that we typically use webjars now, so you may want to ensure you base the samples from an existing sample application. You will notice that all code in the documentation is tested. This is required to ensure we keep high quality documentation.

- In prod the user will be responsible for executing the necessary cql on their own.  I believe that's how it works with the jdbc backend.
- Good call on the consistency setting. By default I believe it's configured through the query options of the cluster, but we should probably allow a configuration option to set it for spring-session operations
- We haven't had any issues with it in prod, but our usage is very limited in scope.  Our application is primarily OAuth based, but we're using spring-session for the initial authentication and account management operations.

- When available, we'll need to add consistency level tuning properties for session read/write queries, as well as a few notes on their impact on cluster performance.
- I understand how we can use the properties in `EnableCassandraHttpSession` to create a `Cluster`, `Session` and a `CassandraOperations` object. However, when working within Spring Boot, can we also use these properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml`? I ask because I read these docs: http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-nosql.html#boot-features-cassandra and saw that there are configuration properties similar to our new `EnableCassandraHttpSession` annotation.

665	"@Fitzoh I had a quick look at your changes.

It seems that you've added too much Cassandra specific configuration that shouldn't be part of `CassandraHttpSessionConfiguration` - namely the configuration of `Cluster` and `Session`. Both of these should be provided by an application you're using Spring Session with. You can use [`RedisHttpSessionConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/blob/master/spring-session/src/main/java/org/springframework/session/data/redis/config/annotation/web/http/RedisHttpSessionConfiguration.java), [`JdbcHttpSessionConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/blob/master/spring-session/src/main/java/org/springframework/session/jdbc/config/annotation/web/http/JdbcHttpSessionConfiguration.java), or any other configuration as a guideline to model Cassandra support config. Notice that Redis and JDBC configs rely on having `RedisConnectionFactory` or `DataSource` provided to them.

Regarding Spring Boot question, Spring Session shouldn't have a dependency on Spring Boot (other than in sample apps) as this would put quite a constraint on users. To put it in other words, Spring Session configuration shouldn't care if it's used in Boot based app or not. The integration between the two is on Spring Boot's side."	2016-11-29 13:56:09	0.0		1

This can now be handled via single call of `IndexResolver#supportsIndex`. I thought you referred to that by _Introducing this new API we have yet another API that needs to be aware of the index names and be kept in sync_.

`Delegate` spec simplifies the `IndexResolver` implementation, with the provided `DefaultIndexResolver` IMO covers all the use cases and avoids having ugly `if-then-else` logic in `IndexResolver` implementations.

Resolving a single index is also pretty common case IMO, there are two examples in `RedisOperationsSessionRepository` alone:
- [`cleanupPrincipalIndex`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/blob/master/spring-session/src/main/java/org/springframework/session/data/redis/RedisOperationsSessionRepository.java#L543)
- [`RedisSession` constructor](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/blob/master/spring-session/src/main/java/org/springframework/session/data/redis/RedisOperationsSessionRepository.java#L699)

> Having the possibility to check whether given index name is supported by the resolver vastly simplifies the checks found in FindByIndexNameSessionRepository#findByIndexNameAndIndexValue implementations. 

Ok. I see your point. Sorry for the confusion. It might be good to continue doing this sort of optimization.

I was planning on having the implementation just attempt to perform the lookup regardless of if the index was supported. If the value wasn't indexed, it would be a null session.

Do you see reason for having both `supportedIndexes` and `supportsIndex` method?

I'd really like to keep this API as simple as possible. I think it may be valuable to remove both the `supportedIndexes` and `supportsIndex` methods. It seems that we will have all the information we need with a single method.

> Delegate spec simplifies the IndexResolver implementation, with the provided DefaultIndexResolver IMO covers all the use cases and avoids having ugly if-then-else logic in IndexResolver implementations.
> ...

Agreed. This is a common use case.

Could this be an abstract class rather than an interface?

> Also with this design we could easily support users adding their own indexes with some FindByIndexNameSessionRepository implementations - they would simply implement Delegate contract and register beans which we would then get automatically register with IndexResolver.

We can do the same by having them provide multiple `FindByIndexNameSessionRepository` implementations. Right?

I see, however I was driven by optimization considerations from the start - why run the resolver logic if we have enough knowledge to know it won't yield any result?

> Do you see reason for having both `supportedIndexes` and `supportsIndex` method?

I agree we probably don't need both, `supportsIndex` is by far more relevant for a typical usage of `IndexResolver`.

> I'd really like to keep this API as simple as possible. I think it may be valuable to remove both the `supportedIndexes` and `supportsIndex` methods. It seems that we will have all the information we need with a single method.

Could you please clarify this a bit more? What single method do you refer to if we remove the both support-methods? Or did you mean remove one of the methods rather than remove both?

> Could this be an abstract class rather than an interface?

Yes, I've also considered such approach.

> We can do the same by having them provide multiple `FindByIndexNameSessionRepository` implementations. Right?

Right. But I feel there should be a single `SessionRepository` bean in the app context, anything else requires some sort of compromise when it comes to consuming the repository.

So to sum things up before I make an update, we'd trim the `IndexResolver` contract to something like this:

``` java
public interface IndexResolver<S extends Session> {

    boolean supportsIndex(String indexName);

    String resolve(S session, String indexName);

    Map<String, String> resolveAll(S session);

}
```

The `Delegate` spec would be moved to the `AbstractIndexResolver`.

> I see, however I was driven by optimization considerations from the start - why run the resolver logic if we have enough knowledge to know it won't yield any result?

We don't know that we are the only repository writing to the data store. There might be something else providing the indexes. Perhaps a background job or another application. 

There is a cost to maintaining this additional code with (in my opinion) little gain. In short, I still think this needs to be removed.

I really think our API should look closer to:

``` java
public interface IndexResolver<S extends Session> {

    Map<String, String> resolveIndexesFor(S session);
}
```

Then we can provide an abstract class that supports resolving a single index. For example:

``` java
public abstract class AbstractSingleIndexResolver<S extends Session>  implements IndexResolver<S> {
    private final String sessionIndexName;

    protected AbstractSingleIndexResolver(String sessionIndexName) {
        this.sessionIndexName = sessionIndexName;
    }

    protected abstract String resolveIndexValueFor(S session);

    public final Map<String,String> resolveIndexesFor(S session) {
        String sessionIndexValue = resolveIndexValueFor(session);
        return sessionIndexValue == null ? Collections.<String,String>emtpyMap() : Collections.singletonMap(sessionIndexName, sessionIndexValue);
    }
}

Why not? Seems you could do this:

``` java

    Map<String,String> resolveIndexes(S session);
}

public class PrincipalNameIndexResolver<S extends Session> implements IndexResolver<S> {
    private SpelExpressionParser parser = new SpelExpressionParser();
    private String indexName = FindByIndexNameSessionRepository.PRINCIPAL_NAME_INDEX_NAME;

    public String resolvePrincipal(Session session) {
        String principalName = session.getAttribute(FindByIndexNameSessionRepository.PRINCIPAL_NAME_INDEX_NAME);
        if(principalName != null) {
            return principalName;
        }
        Object authentication = session.getAttribute(""SPRING_SECURITY_CONTEXT"");
        if(authentication != null) {
            Expression expression = parser.parseExpression(""authentication?.name"");
            return expression.getValue(authentication, String.class);
        }
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, String> resolveIndexes(S session) {
        String index = resolvePrincipal(session);
        if(index == null) {
            return Collections.emptyMap();
        }
        return Collections.singletonMap(indexName, index);
    }
}

public class GemfireIndexResolver<S extends Session> implements IndexResolver<S> {
    private PrincipalNameIndexResolver<S> principalResolver = new PrincipalNameIndexResolver<>();

    @Override
    public Map<String, String> resolveIndexes(S session) {
        Map<String, String> gemfireIndexes = resolveThem(session);
        gemfireIndexes.putAll(principalResolver.resolveIndexes(session));

Yes, that's by design since I originally intended `IndexResolver` implementations to be single purpose. Each `FindByIndexNameSessionRepository` implementation holds the knowledge of its supported indexes anyway, doesn't it? Or did you mean _another API_ as in API targeted at users? Perhaps `FindByIndexNameSessionRepository` interface itself should communicate the index names it is capable of resolving?

> Why not? Seems you could do this:

That kind of implementation is exactly what I wanted to avoid :) Your `GemfireIndexResolver` will get messy once other `IndexResolver` resolvers get in there too since you're relying on the concrete `IndexResolver` implementation.

Regarding your proposed `IndexResolver` API and Gemfire implementation, consider things from perspective of current usage of `PrincipalNameResolver`s and equivalent logic - you'd really like to run the resolving for all the indexes and then extract the single value you're interested in instead of current `PrincipalNameResolver#resolvePrincipal`?

760	"> Each FindByIndexNameSessionRepository implementation holds the knowledge of its supported indexes anyway, doesn't it? 

It does. Introducing this new API we have yet another API that needs to be aware of the index names and be kept in sync. The proposed change allows all the index logic to be moved into the new resolver api.

> Your GemfireIndexResolver will get messy once other IndexResolver resolvers get in there too since you're relying on the concrete IndexResolver implementation.

How would this be cleaner with the original design? Either way you would need to have that specific functionality.

Right, but the logic to resolve the index would be able to be reused. This is the goal. If we need adapters to translate the results of the IndexResolver into implementation specific code this is much easier than rewriting the code for resolving the indexes.

> What are you thoughts on making it a part of FindByIndexNameSessionRepository?
- This interface is already GA, so we cannot add a new method on it
- I don't think this is the right place for it. User's do not care what the indexes are. It is the internal implementation that cares about the indexes. So the `FindByIndexNameSessionRepository` implementation would have an `IndexResolver` injected into it.

I don't know if it is possible, but I'd like to see an option similar to REDIS and JDBC repositories which only writes the session attribute that changed. For example, if I invoke:

```
session.setAttribute(""foo"",""bar"");
repo.save(session);
session.setAttribute(""new"",""test"");
repo.save(session);
```

The second save should not need to write the session attribute ""foo"". This helps reduce the likely hood of a race condition. At minimum it would be good to try to ensure if the last update time is changed, that only that needs to be written vs the entire Session.

This might not be possible with Hazelcast, but I'd like to make sure we investigate this possibility.

``` java
Session session = ...;
User user = session.getAttribute(""user"");

Currently this change will be visible. However, with the changes, setAttribute will not have been invoked and thus the change will not persist.

For this reason, we should probably add a flag named something like `persistOnSessionChange` which defaults to false.

835	"> Decide whether to provide an option on persistence mode (single BLOB vs individual attributes)

There might be one another choice for this. Individual attributes are required in scenarios where they have to be updated outside from the application such as cron jobs. In these cases actually we are just interested in some attributes not all of them. Simple session attributes which are updated only by user are not necessary to be stored in individual attributes table. I do not know what can we do for this but I just wanted to share this as well.   

Thank you so much for everything. <3

Interesting approach on attributes persistence. It seems optimal from the perspective of number of BLOBs involved but I see two downsides - it makes the configuration more complex, and it seems to require some extra logic in session handling.

The more I look at this the more it seems to me that individual attributes is the way to go. The only downside is the performance on initial save but I've been able to optimize that a bit by using `JdbcTemplate#batchUpdate`.

I'm wondering if we would be able to support the concept of marking the session as expired by setting a session attribute rather than deleting the session. Then when Spring Session obtains the `SessionInformation` it would read this attribute to determine if the session is expired.

Honestly, I do like the fact that the current implementation deletes the session, but this might be a nice feature for users who need the ability to display a more useful error message.

Thoughts?

888	"A custom session attribute to support ""Spring Security expiration"" makes a lot of sense. I'll update the implementation and docs to ensure that this in place. This will also cause the filtering on expired session to actually do something useful, since it won't conflate Spring Security's notion of an expired session with that of Spring Session: they're different things, 
I could also support repositories that return plain Sessions rather than ExpiringSessions this way: the SessionRegistry already gets a callback to update the last accessed timestamp of a session, so for plain Sessions (that don't provide this information themselves like ExpiringSessions do) we could store the info in another custom session attribute. The code could determine and cache whether plain or expiring sessions are being returned by the repository, so the additional overhead of updating the Session with a last accessed attribute would only be incurred for plain Sessions. Do you think that this is worth the trouble, or will all relevant implementations implement ExpiringSession anyway, in your opinion?

2. There is almost none additional complexity for a developer. If you don't want to use them you can set the same namespace in all your apps in the system or use only global namespace. Maybe by default namespaces support could be turned off.

I think I'd prefer to allow the user to create the transactional boundary by exposing a bean of a particular name. 
- This aligns with Spring Session's other points of customization. For example, this is how we users can provide custom serializers. 
- Additionally, using a bean provides more flexibility for the user than the boolean flag on the annotation (which can only be on or off).

I guess this makes sense, and it actually makes the job quite easier for us in terms of implementation as well as testing. Documentation should provide some concrete examples for this approach.

Do you prefer to keep offer this only for write operations, or read ones as well?

I've been doing some more thinking about this and I think you two have convinced me that my approach was not ideal. We should work out of the box, so I think you two are right that we should create the transactions by default.

What's more is we can always make it optional later on and still remain passive. If we start without requiring it and it causes problems, we are stuck with this default to remain passive.

@vpavic I'm sorry on flip-flopping on this, but hopefully getting to the ""right answer"" is some consultation. Do you mind updating the PR to take these changes into account.

If I'm reading this correctly you wouldn't provide an option for users to disable transactions right now, but rather at some later stage if there's need for this?

972	"@rwinch I've considered using this in sample app too but eventually decided to limit use to integration tests.

My reasoning was the following:
- Flapdoodle on [its website](https://flapdoodle-oss.github.io/de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo/) clearly states the project is aimed at running Mongo in tests so we should follow this
- IMO sample apps should provide a realistic use case of how to use the framework
- sample apps include instructions on how to browse the session data using clients for underlying technology used to persist sessions, meaning you need Mongo (client at least) anyway to fully benefit from sample app (and I don't know how Mongo client would work with an embedded Flapdoodle instance)

This is in contrast to JDBC samples for example, which use H2 database, since H2 is full-blown RDBMS which also offers easily embeddable web client.

973	"@vpavic Thank you for your feedback. I somewhat see your point about the samples needing to provide a realistic experience for users. However, we do not want any extra noise for setting up samples.

Fladoodle should certainly not be used in production, but I think it is ideal for helping users run a sample application. We are testing the sample with Fladoodle so that is how users should experience it (since we know that is what works).

Finally Fladoodle is just downloading the executable and forking a process that starts up a full fledged Mongo instance. This means that this does not differ much from using an embedded relational database.

But OK, if that's your preference I'll move the sample app to Flapdoodle.

There's one more thing that crossed my mind today, and I've completely neglected it during initial implementation - embedded Flapdoodle instance needs to use random port to avoid any potential conflicts. That means in sample app scenario we also need to communicate this port to the user - is logging the port on startup good enough for this?

That is fair. However, I think there are many people that will not care about performing the steps with the client (they just want to get it running). We should have a disclaimer that you must have a client installed within the guide.

> That means in sample app scenario we also need to communicate this port to the user - is logging the port on startup good enough for this?

This is an option. Alternatively (and probably preferably), we could default the port to using the standard port and ensure our test configuration overrides this to a random port.

2..x - CustomApp Session (One session per CustomApp)
- Different redisNamespace 
- Different RedisSerializer (other ClassLoader)
- This session only have objects of CustomApp

The configuration file of CustomApp I set a different namespace and use the custom **SessionRepository** and **SessionRepositoryFilter**

``` java
public class CustomRootSessionConfiguration extends RedisHttpSessionConfiguration {

        String redisNamespace = getRedisNamespace();
        if(StringUtils.hasText(redisNamespace)) {
            sessionRepository.setRedisKeyNamespace(redisNamespace);
        }

        sessionRepository.setRedisFlushMode(redisFlushMode);
        return sessionRepository;

        sessionRepositoryFilter.setServletContext(servletContext);
        sessionRepositoryFilter.setHttpSessionStrategy(httpSessionStrategy);
        return sessionRepositoryFilter;
    }
}
```

``` java
public class CustomRootSessionRepositoryFilter<S extends ExpiringSession> extends SessionRepositoryFilter<S> {
// --------------------------- CONSTRUCTORS ---------------------------

    public CustomRootSessionRepositoryFilter(SessionRepository<S> sessionRepository) {
        super(sessionRepository);
    }

// -------------------------- OTHER METHODS --------------------------

    @Override
    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain) throws ServletException, IOException {
        String customRootName = CustomRootUtils.getCustomRootName(request.getRequestURI());
        if (StringUtils.isEmpty(customRootName)) {

        SessionRepositoryRequestWrapper<S> sessionRepositoryRequestWrapper = new SessionRepositoryRequestWrapper<>(request, response, servletContext, sessionRepository, httpSessionStrategy);
        sessionRepositoryRequestWrapper.setSessionAttribute(""CustomSessionRepositoryRequestWrapper"");
        sessionRepositoryRequestWrapper.getSession();
        return sessionRepositoryRequestWrapper;
    }
}
```

I created sessionAttribute field to change the name of Session Objects attribute, because the class SessionRepositoryRequestWrapper save a ""cache"" on `request.setAttribute`, to don't get objects of CEAP Session. 

``` java
sessionRepositoryRequestWrapper.setSessionAttribute(""CustomSessionRepositoryRequestWrapper"");
```

**This filter run before the Custom App run.**

``` java
public class CustomRedisOperationsSessionRepository extends RedisOperationsSessionRepository {
// --------------------------- CONSTRUCTORS ---------------------------

    public CustomRedisOperationsSessionRepository(RedisConnectionFactory redisConnectionFactory) {
        super(redisConnectionFactory);
    }

    public CustomRedisOperationsSessionRepository(RedisOperations<Object, Object> sessionRedisOperations) {
        super(sessionRedisOperations);
    }

// ------------------------ INTERFACE METHODS ------------------------


// --------------------- Interface SessionRepository ---------------------

    @Override
    public RedisSession getSession(String id) {
        RedisSession redisSession = super.getSession(id);
        if (redisSession == null)
            redisSession = new RedisSession(new MapSession(id));
        return redisSession;
    }
}
```

I override method getSession to get the CustomApp Session, if the session is null, I created a new RedisSession empty with the same sessionId. If I don't override this method, the code will be create a new session with a different sessionId and changed the cookie.

From what I understand, you can do this without any changes to Spring Session. You can create a new instance of `SessionRepositoryFilter` for each ""CustomApp"". The ""CustomApp"" `SessionRepositoryFilter` will only intercept requests for the specific ""CustomApp"" by either changing the servlet mappings or using something like Spring Security's `DelegatingFilterProxy`.

My concern about the proposed changes is that this appears to be a bit of an edge case. While I understand why you need these changes, I don't want to make the code more complicated for the 95% case. As outlined above, I think you can fairly easily achieve this without changes. For these reasons, I'm closing this as won't fix.

1030	"Hi @rwinch 

I do this, I have 2 filters

1- CEAP (SessionRepositoryFilter)
2- CustomApp (CustomSessionRepositoryFilter)

But when the second filter run, the filter get the session of CEAP, because we have today this code below on SessionRepositoryFilter.java

Class SessionRepositoryRequestWrapper

``` java
@Override
        public HttpSessionWrapper getSession(boolean create) {
            HttpSessionWrapper currentSession = getCurrentSession();
            if(currentSession != null) {
                return currentSession;
            }
                        ...
               }
```

The method getCurrentSession it's a cache that put the session on request.

``` java
               private void setCurrentSession(HttpSessionWrapper currentSession) {
            if(currentSession == null) {
                removeAttribute(CURRENT_SESSION_ATTR);
            } else {
                setAttribute(CURRENT_SESSION_ATTR, currentSession);
            }
        }
```

To change the CURRENT_SESSION_ATTR, I created a field named sessionAttribute, to have on the Request more than one session on ""cache""

- Use ConcurrentHashMap for the queryCache. Access and fill can be concurrent.

- Since `tablePrefix` is not intended to be changed in runtime, concurrency is not an issue. However, synchronizing `queryCache` operations inside `getQuery` method might be a good idea.
- Prefix allows for a limited customization of table name. This is a common approach used in many frameworks, for example Spring Integration, Spring Batch, Quartz Scheduler, etc. to avoid possible name clashes with other entities in your app and make it possible to have multiple repo's backed by the same database schema.

Thanks for the response. I would still like these to be static final Strings rather than enums.

I see where you got the idea from. I know this is a coding style change (especially since this is all private). However, making this change will better align with Spring Session's code style and provide consistency in the project. Additionally, it will make it easier to allow custom queries w/ very little effort if we every go down that path.

You can have a boolean on the `JdbcSession` that is changed when any property (other than lastAccesedTime) is set. If the boolean changes then you would persist everything, else persist only the lastAccessedTime. In fact, you might keep track of if lastAccessedTime is written too and only persist if that changes.

You would likely need a different SQL statement that could be injected for this special case.

I also considered this initially, but opted to go the route seen in Integration's `JdbcMessageStore`.

My reasoning was that in practice the `Session` object is closer to Integration's `Message` than it is to Security's `UserDetails` due to `Session` being entity which is internal to the framework unlike `UserDetails` which is often derived and constructed from some application domain entity provided by users. That's why the `enum` approach seemed like a good approach to me.

Not sure if we really have some gain from the `enum`, but that might be some `hash` performance producing for the `HashMap` key...

From other side `steal` isn't applied between Spring projects. You use code from one Spring project in the another, therefore this word should be treated as enough soft.

We probably wouldn't advice placing something like session in a shared database (although this would still be possible with a little bit of work). Typically different applications would use different username / password for their database connection. The different users could have different default schema which would isolate the sessions.

We could certainly create a separate ticket for adding a table prefix and see if it gets enough votes, but don't think we'd add something like this in an initial release (once we add something it cannot be removed).

Therefore I think allowing users to customize the table prefix is not some exotic requirement but rather a failry common thing we heavily rely on with other frameworks we use regulary:
- [Spring Integration](http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/docs/4.2.5.RELEASE/reference/html/jdbc.html#jdbc-message-store-generic)

Even though the `FindByIndexNameSessionRepository` javadoc claims that _Spring Session is not aware of the authentication mechanism being used_, concrete implementations are still somewhat tied to Spring Security - I've made it possible to set a custom `PrincipalNameResolver` in `RedisOperationsSessionRepository`, however `saveDelta` method still relies on `SPRING_SECURITY_CONTEXT` key.

`AbstractGemFireOperationsSessionRepository` requires some refactoring to make it possible to customize `PrincipalNameResolver`. If this PR is accepted I can tackle this some time later (if Gemfire integration author cannot do it).
"	2016-02-20 23:14:45	0.0		1
1098	"@vpavic Thanks for the PR! 

While I can see that this looks like a good idea, I don't think we want to do this just yet. The reason we have duplicated the logic is because we want to keep the implementation details private (so they can change later).

You may notice that right now the API is specific to resolving a principal name. However, `FindByIndexNameSessionRepository` supports finding by a generic index name. This means we would likely want to update the API to support generic index names. However, we will not have enough time to do this before things go GA.

Another consideration is that we would like to see what shapes up from the [Redis support](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-redis/pull/156/files#diff-d2c04ffe360655561105d34b8ba1d122R31). We may find we can simply use some Spring Data Commons support rather than providing our own (I'm currently in talks with the Spring Data Team about this idea).

For these reasons, I'm going to close this PR and in favor of #376 for us to address this once we know what is happening within Spring Data. Thank you for pointing out this was undocumented issue!

Thanks again for the PR (sorry the issue wasn't documented)! I'm looking forward to seeing support for #364

I understand your reasoning, the changes provided with this PR would've been a more natural fit with `FindByIndexNameSessionRepository`'s predecessor - `FindByPrincipalNameSessionRepository`. Since a move to more generic index name base repository is made, the same should apply to the proposed Resolver.

I'd be happy to make another contribution when #376 shapes up with more concrete details.

Perhaps the right answer might be to keep `MongoExpiringSession` public (but mark final) and allow the Converter to inject the query on the `MongoExpiringSession`. The `MongoSessionRepository` already requires `MongoSessionRepository` so it could obtain the query from the `MongoExpiringSession`. This way all the query information is kept within the converters.

I just find it easier to generate the wrapper using my current version of Gradle (it doesn't need the task actually defined in newer versions of Gradle).

I typically update the wrapper by modifying the properties file directly to avoid changing any updates that may have been made to things like the [default java options](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/blob/3df40dd8a9ada28e3217c15482cfe1f74812fdf1/gradlew#L10)

# Use AssertJ not Hamcrest

Spring Session uses AssertJ not Hamcrest for assertions. It would be best if the end result uses AssertJ. I can take care of this for you or you can do it (just let me know what you decide).

**NOTE**: This is a minor thing that I can take care of myself if necessary

Quite a few of the tests are using Hamcrest. Spring Session uses AssertJ for assertions

# Use Available Port for Gemfire server

We can use a static port for a client (i.e. Redis samples) if the CI server instances all have a server running on that port. However, we cannot guarantee a port will be available for the server to run on. This is particularly true since Spring Session might build two branches at the same time which would mean that one branch would fail since the port isn't available.

Instead, we should ensure that any servers should use an available port. You can check this out with the Hazelcast example which uses Spring's `SocketUtils.findAvailableTcpPort()`. If you want you can make the port static for the sample, but the integration tests should be dynamic.

1236	"Yes.  There are several reasons:
1. I wanted to have a clean separation between the basic CRUD operations implemented in the concrete class (e.g. GemFireOperationsSessionRepository) and the event handling/translation logic that would be common (literally the same) for all concrete classes.  The GemFire cache event to Spring Session event translation is, or rather should be, consistent across all GemFire SessionRepository implementations.  The concrete implementation should only have to focus on implementing the CRUD operations IMO.
2. Also, the AbstractGemFireSessionRepository handles ""registering"" the GemFireOperationSessionRepository as a ""CacheListener"" on the appropriate GemFire component without the user having to know which component (i.e. the GemFire Region storing Session state).
3. Next, I have just moved the GemFireSession class (along with a new GemFireSessionAttributes supporting class) to the AbstractGemFireSessionRepository class to simplify future SessionRepository implementations based on GemFire.  For instance, another possible implementation might be to use SD's Repository abstraction (i.e. GemfireRepository) to back the SessionRepository based on GemFire.  This was what Vinicius did in his implementation of Spring Session GemFire support, but his approach was quite brittle in how he registered the repo.

There are subtle other reasons, but the 3 points above capture my main intent.  I had thought about naming this class `GemFireSessionRepositorySupport`, but I have not renamed it yet.

I extracted out the `SessionEventRegistry` class that was in `RedisOperationsSessionRepositoryITests` because it seemed generally useful in integration tests handling SessionEvents regardless of the implementation. Furthermore, I wrote the tests so far in a completely agnostic manner to whether it is Redis or Hazelcast underneath. It might be nice if we can have the same set of integration tests run against a config with Redis and Hazelcast without having to duplicate the code (which I did do a little bit). I thought this task might be a bit out of scope for this pull request, though.

Next I will write some IT specific to the Hazelcast implementation. Any hints on how to test that the entry listener is actually removed upon shutdown?

@manderson23 The problem is, as far as I can tell, we have no way to know if the user configured `maxIdleSeconds` as 0 or if they did not configure it and it is just 0 by default. In case they configured it as 0, I think we would want to respect that and not overwrite it.

I'm leaning more towards having to change the default attribute value to 0 to match to default of `maxIdleSeconds`. Then the user can configure it themselves and we will only override if a value is passed to `maxInactiveIntervalInSeconds`. Though this is different than the Redis configuration, I believe.

Hazelcast can be used for many things, so setting it to 0 may make sense when there is no context. However, when considered for an HttpSession we should be conscious that the default needs to be secure. A default that prevents expiration is not what I would consider secure.

I'm wondering why this needs to be configured externally vs using the annotation. Can you elaborate?

One option is we could make the maxInactiveIntervalInSeconds attribute a String. If the value was """", then we would use the value configured externally. The default would still be 1800 to preserve a secure by default setting. Thoughts?

> Please let me know if anything else needs to be done.

One issue is that the existing Hazelcast sample was a demonstration that Spring Session could work without any Spring Dependencies. I'd like to keep the existing sample application that way.

One option we could do is remove the Spring dependencies from  your sample application. Although I think that defeats the purpose of the events (which we want).

The other option is to add this as a new sample. I haven't  thought of the name very long, but perhaps something like hazelcast-spring. I think this option is the better of the two. If you have a better idea for the name, I'd love suggestions :)

> There are a couple of places where indentation etc. could be fixed. Do you have an Eclipse format XML file for your coding standard? Or can you point me to a coding standard.

I took a look at the PR and have made some [minor changes](https://github.com/rwinch/spring-session/tree/gh-267) in my branch.

I also have a few concerns / comments about the implementation that we could perhaps discuss.

# Possible Inconsistent Session

My concern is that if someone sets the Session on the SessionContextHolder, then it is not reflected on the HttpSession. This seems like it could lead to inconsistencies. For example, if in the service tier someone did the following:

``` java
SimpSessionContext context = new SimpSessionContext();
context.setSession(session);
SessionContextHolder.setContext(context);
```

Then later on in the web tier someone attempted to access the `HttpSession`:

``` java
HttpSession session = request.getSession();
```

The two sessions would not be the same id (thus have different instances).

I'm thinking it may be best to do some refactoring to account for this.

# SessionContext necessary?

With the above refactoring I don't think that SessionContext is necessary. Instead the Session can be set and accessed directly. The HttpSessionWrapper would look up the value in the SessionContextHolder rather than save as a request attribute. I believe there may be instances where it needs to fall back to obtain the Session from the request attribute, but generally it could access the SessionContextHolder.

# TBD

What are your thoughts? If you agree I'm happy to do the cleanup or I am happy to have you send an updated PR.

1296	"Hi @rwinch,

The changes makes sense :+1:.

Regarding the inconsistency, this is a real problem.

About the `SessionContext`, it was introduced to abstract the `SessionContextHolder` from the responsible to provide/create the session instance. Within a http request for example, session should be created only if requested. If `SessionContextHolder.getSession()` is implemented, from my point of view, it should do what `HttpServletRequest.getSession()` does, covering the case in which `getSession()` is first invoked from service tier using `SessionContextHolder`.

I had tried out some things, among them to use `SessionContextHolder` from `ExpiringSessionHttpSession`, but once `SessionContextHolder.getSession()` returns `Session` some ugly unchecked cast to `S` (`<S extends ExpiringSession>`) are required. I will think further about it, but would be happy if there are any ideas/suggestions to solve the problem, maybe I'm just not seeing the big picture.

You bring up a good point. It would be nice to be able to create a new session from anywhere within the application. However, I think we would also need a way to inspect to see if there is a session already.

> but once SessionContextHolder.getSession() returns Session some ugly unchecked cast
> S (<S extends ExpiringSession>) are required.

Given it is a static method there is no way to and the type short of adding a generic type capture to the method. This would be consistent with the way `<T> T Session.getAttribute(String)` works too.

For example, `SessionContextHolder` could be something like this:

``` java
public static <S extends Session> getSession() {
    ...
}
```

Obviously this would still require a cast, but it would be more isolated.

1298	"Hi @rwinch,

Using `SessionContextHolder` as a central point to hold the session is a good idea, but I'm still trying to understand when should the `Session` be set to `SessionContextHolder`, considering `SessionContext` is removed. 
If it is done within the `doFilter` (`SessionRepositoryFilter.doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, FilterChain)`), we need to try to fetch the session from the repository even if it is not used during the request. And if it is set when it is retrieved from the request object (`SessionRepositoryRequestWrapper.getSession(boolean)`), we wouldn't have the session available before executing `HttpServletRequest.getSession(boolean)`.

Suggestions?

I'm also thinking we should keep SessionContextHolder simple and remove the strategies and just use an `InheritableThreadLocal`. `RequestContextHolder` in spring-web doesn't need the strategies and since we could passively introduce strategies, I'd prefer to wait until we need them.

The `CookiePathCalculationStrategy` is a nice touch but I wonder if it could be made a little more broad (and thus more useful). Clearly the purpose of the `CookieHttpSessionStrategy` class is to manage HTTP sessions via cookies and therefore the `createSessionCookie()` method is of critical importance. Wouldn't it be better to use the strategy pattern on the creation of the cookie itself rather than on only the path? For example:

```
public interface CookieCreationStrategy {
    Cookie createSessionCookie(HttpServletRequest, Map<String, String> sessionIds);
}
```

The default implementation (ie. `DefaultCookieCreationStrategy()`) could be exactly the same code that is currently in `CookieHttpSessionStrategy.createSessionCookie()` but using a strategy pattern would allow one to customize the way the cookie is created including things like setting the cookie domain or setting a custom path. One complication would be that `createSessionCookie()` currently uses some member variables but that isn't insurmountable.

Just a suggestion...but this approach seems a bit more flexible.

OR. Another far simpler approach would be to remove the `final` qualifier from `CookieHttpSessionStrategy` and allow for inheritance (noting the somewhat questionable value of doing so it certainly would be pragmatic).

The issue happens because Spring Boot 1.2.1's [RedisAutoConfiguration](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/v1.2.1.RELEASE/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/redis/RedisAutoConfiguration.java#L76) requires `RedisSentinelConfiguration` which is not available until Spring Data Redis 1.4.0

## Why does Boot allow a version mismatch?

Spring Boot is suppose to manage my versions for me. So how did this happen?

### Boot Gradle only manages unspecified versions

This happens because Spring Boot's Gradle plugin currently only manages unspecified versions (not transitive versions). That means when using Spring Boot 1.2.1 that a configuration like this:

``` groovy
compile 'org.springframework.session:spring-session-data-redis:1.0.0.RELEASE'
```

will bring in Spring Data Redis 1.3.0 resolved from Spring Session Data Redis 1.0.0.RELEASE.

### Additional Workaround

You could also work around this issue using the following:

``` groovy
compile 'org.springframework.session:spring-session-redis:1.0.0.RELEASE'
compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-redis'
```

Instead of using spring-session-data-redis, we only include spring-session and allow Spring Boot's starter pom to bring in all our Redis dependencies. I created #125 to improve our sample and documentation.

### Spring Boot Gradle 1.3+ Adding Dependency Management

Spring Boot 1.3 is currently scheduled to include the dependency management plugin which will ensure transitive dependencies are also managed. [See spring-boot/issues/2133](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/2133).

## How did it get past our Build?

So the question is...""How did this get past our build?""

### Samples use Spring Boot 1.10

We do have integration tests and a CI build that verify all of the Spring Session samples work. This includes a Spring Boot sample. However, the Spring Boot sample is on 1.10 version of Spring Boot. Since you are using [Spring Boot 1.2.1](https://twitter.com/danveloper/status/559439175737282560) with spring-session-data-redis you are getting conflicting versions.

### Spring IO Checks

We also certify that Spring Session works with Spring IO 1.1.1 versions (which means it should work with Spring Boot 1.2.1). More concretely, this means we re-run all the tests with the versions found in Spring IO 1.1.1. The reason this works is because the Spring IO plugin changes ALL of the versions to match the versions found in Spring IO. This means that even though we declare a dependency on version Spring Data Redis 1.3.0 within our build when we certify against Spring IO we ensure all the versions are Spring IO versions including Spring Data Redis. This means that our tests will pass.

# Changes in Spring Session?

So what changes should we make to Spring Session? Initially we used Spring Data Redis 1.3.0 as we viewed this as the minimum version of Spring Data that could be used. This ensured that our tests ran against Spring Data 1.3.0 and then re-ran (when using Spring IO Checks) against the latest version.

However, this does seem cause some headaches in transitive versions. It also does not make it easy to follow the best practice of being on the latest and greatest.

Ultimately, I think we should update all of our versions to match the Spring IO Versions #126 and then create additional testing to verify our minimum versions as described in #120

[CookieHttpSessionStrategy](http://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/api/org/springframework/session/web/http/CookieHttpSessionStrategy.html) provides the mechanism for overriding default values of the cookie associated with the HTTP session.

The following values are configurable.
- **Name** - The name of the cookie. The default value is SESSION.
- **Maximum Age** - The maximum age of the cookie in seconds. This value has the same behaviour as [javax.servlet.http.Cookie.setMaxAge](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html#setMaxAge%28int%29) The default value is -1.

1380	"> I added this HttpSessionStrategy implementation based on your suggestion on how multiple sessions can be handled by a custom HttpSessionStrategy. 

Thanks!

> The idea is pretty much the same as described in issue #48 except the current session cookie stores the session id instead of the index. 

We probably want it to use an index so that we can also extract the index from the URL (more on that later)

> I am not sure how practical this implementation is because it relies very much on the user request including or excluding appropriate cookies to either initiate a new session, use an existing one, delete an existing session etc. 

The thought is that you would need another Filter that interacts with the same API that switches which session you are using.

> Secondly having separate implementations for multiple sessions vs single sessions seems a bit odd too but may be thats ok.

This is a good point...perhaps we should switch this around so it works with a single implementation. The problem is then we complicate our APIs. We want the required API for someone to implement to be as simple as possible. Basically the minimum API should be dead simple so others can provide custom strategies.

> Can you share some thoughts on how automatic url rewriting can help with that. E.g in this implementation, absence of or empty current session cookie suggests the need of a new session so instead may be a request parameter can be specified and SessionRepositoryFilter can invoke another method on HttpSessionStrategy to indicate that a new session is needed regardless of existing valid session.

The idea is that the URL would contain an index of which session we should be using. This way a user could have multiple tabs open at the same time all leveraging different sessions. If the current session is indicated by a cookie, then there can only be one session per browser since cookies would be shared across multiple tabs.

> If this implementation isnt practical please suggest how you are thinking the api can be expanded to accommodate multiple sessions. I would love to help.

I think this is a good start at an implementation, but it may be a bit early. The main reason, as I mentioned previously in #12, the APIs will be changing so we shouldn't implement the current API but wait until #12 is completed.

Fortunately, the thought and comments you have put into this issue will be quite helpful when I implement #12.

In the meantime, lets leave this open as I'm guessing a lot of your work can be easily converted into working with the new APIs once they are rewritten.

1396	"@koentsje I thought for a while about the equals implementation and I'm not 100% sure either way. I was swayed by the default implementation that Eclipse generates, which checks that the classes are the same.

If the classes _aren't_ the same then it's not equal. I think that's fair actually. In a Hibernate situation I don't _think_ there's a case where an object would be considered equal and not be the exact same class. But it would be possible to setup two separate entities in the database, with separate id spaces, and have the implementation class of one extend the other, in which case `isAssignableFrom()` would be true, and the ids could match as they're separate entity tables, and we'd get a false positive.

So I guess now I am pretty sure that it needs to be equal classes!

1397	"@karlvr I see two problems with this approach. The first and obvious one is that you add a dependency on the Hibernate runtime for the generated entities, which is something we want to avoid. The second problem is that I think that in the context of ORM the equality does not at all require that the classes are the same. Equality in the context of the entities implies that they represent the same row in the database. Two objects that are instances of different classes in the same class hierarchy can very well indicate the same row in a database and hence should be able to be equal. These two reasons is why I prefer to keep the 'instanceof' check. I have tried to solve the problem as I understood it and opened #57.

This has two side effects. We'll take CDI as an example:

1. Before this change, if someone tried to use Hibernate Search during CDI beans initialization, the call would block because Hibernate Search wasn't initialized yet, which would result in a deadlock since Hibernate Search waits for CDI to be initialized. After this change, such calls will simply fail. So in that respect, I guess this change is a good thing.
2. Before this change, if someone tried to use Hibernate Search *just after* CDI beans initialization, before Hibernate Search had the time to fully initialize, the call would block, and resume once Hibernate Search is fully initialized. After this change, such calls will simply fail. And **that** is not a good thing...

Having experienced the thrilling task of adding a Wildfly/CDI integration test, I have mixed feelings about this statement :grin:

If that's true, we shouldn't bother with blocking calls anywhere, not even in `InitializingIntegratorState` for instance... should we?

Also, you seem to assume that the container itself will take care of integration. As we know, this will probably take years, if it ever happens. So I suspect users will have to take care of that for a time, and they may not have access to as much internals as Wildfly developpers, preventing them to control the execution order as delicately.

I removed the increase in the refresh interval in my commit and amended the commit to use polling. On my machine, executing only the `#discovery()` test takes about 5s, while executing the `#simple()` test takes about 2.5s. So we wait for approximately 2.5s.

Actually that's the opposite: what I did in the previous PR was to skip the production of JARs when there is nothing to put in it. When skipIfEmpty is true, no JAR will be generated if there is no classes/resources to put in it.

This is an improvement for most modules, since we won't publish empty, useless JARs anymore. We mostly used to for pom-packaging modules and for test-jar artifacts in modules without tests.

But in the case of the ""distribution"" module, this module had no classes and still had a JAR packaging. Maven doesn't like when a module has a JAR packaging and doesn't produce any JAR, so the build started to fail.

Fair enough, it's indeed pointless but remember we only publish what gets deployed to Maven central: we can ""skip deploy"" on case by case and still use the jars for other purposes during the build.

I only see two ways to configure it (see `createSimilarity`): the index-level configuration, and the default configuration. Since entities are not taken into account when retrieving the `Similarity` (only the index and the more global `SearchConfiguration`), I don't see how we could have two entities in the same index with a different `Similarity`... ?

1705	"It's taking me a long time to wrap my head around the changes, but I like it so far. Reminiscent of various things that I wished to do in the past but it never was a good time in terms of branch maintenance.

On the kind of Dispatchers: I'm not seeing any specific problem, but remember that there's more going on than simple ""streams of changes"" and ""transactional changes"".

We need to keep in mind also that in different circumstances there are strong expectations about ordering of fired events: order needs to be strictly maintained even in ""async mode"", which means we can't just delegate to a parallel executor at any stage.

To the contrary when doing batch rebuilding (MassIndexer) the strict ordering is a burden which prevents fast index rebuilds. However even in that case, there are some operations which need to be kept in order:
 - the purgeAll before the MassIndexer runs need to happen strictly before the subsequent tasks
 - any final optimisation needs to happen after the last (less critical but still desirable)
 
Finally we need to allow for the ""transactional operations"" and MassIndexer operations to happen concurrently: say the MassIndexer is processing, and in parallel some database changes are performed. Our listeners will have to stack up the events fired from the transactional changes making sure that their relative order is maintained, and also that they overwrite any in-flight work from the mass-indexer. 

In the past it seems I had a clear picture in mind of the backend design, as it was simple enough to reason about this and see that it was correct. I can no longer load the whole picture in mind by simply reading the source code, so I think we should eventually add some tests at least to ensure the ordering properties.

Adding such tests is unrelated with this PR but I felt like sharing the concern already as this new design is making some subtle changes in the area."	2017-04-21 09:22:58	0.0		1

It seems to me that such ""synchronisations"" in the work stream are what @gustavonalle added recently, with `org.hibernate.search.backend.impl.batch.DefaultBatchBackend.awaitAsyncProcessingCompletion()`.

I did not expect them to do this either, to be honest. Just wanted to avoid leaky abstractions internally.

It doesn't seems _very_ hard to get a listing of all categories; Ctrl + Shift + G with my cursor on the constructor of `LogCategory` does the trick in Eclipse.

1794	"I have a theory - I couldn't verify yet - but I suspect the problem is simply caused by the fact that the reactive threads of the async http client aren't shut down aggressively but just ""scheduled to close gracefully"".

This graceful shutdown happens rather quickly, but it should take at least a full second as the selector needs to wake up first (and has a 1s timeout by default), so we don't notice any leak when debugging a single test yet I see ~2500+ threads over JConsole during the testsuite.

The testsuite takes longer than 1s but since the amount of threads to be shut down quickly raises in the hundreds, the scheduler isn't going to wake them all up as aggressively so this 1s wakeup time becomes longer.. coumpounding the problem.

I think we either find a way to block and wait for the shutdown to have happened, or we just avoid the explosive scheduling issue by setting a lower setting in the testsuite:

1795	"@Sanne Interesting.
You commit actually reduces the number of leaked file descriptors for each search factory from 64 to 10. It's better, though I don't understand why 10 times less threads translates into 6.4 times less leaked file descriptors.
On the other hand, setting max_total_connection to 2 means we end up with ours tests only being able to perform 2 concurrent calls to Elasticsearch. Which supposedly was what made performance tests fail on the CI, and is what I tried to solve in my first commit...

So I'm a bit torn here: it seems we end up exactly where we started from, and had some luck with the CI... I'll try to see what those 10 leaked file descriptors are, maybe it can shed some light on the issue..."	2017-03-20 09:24:52	1.0	2017-03-20 19:47:53	0

1824	"Thanks for the summary, it's good to think about these combinations.

I agree with most of your thoughts, but to make sure we're on the same page:

 - remember that by default we send operations to the backend _after_ the database changes are committed. So your first case (sync + refreshAfterWrite) is described correctly as you state, but remember that even if an error gets synhcornously reported it won't abort the database changes. Essentially there's a third parameter for these combinations: happens within the transaction vs happens after commit.

 - for the case ""async + refreshAfterWrite"" - which you agree makes less sense - I believe that ES won't actually perform any periodic refresh on its own if no changes have been applied so even that minor benefit is not really there. Essentially we should agree that this mode is quite pointless, should we warn against it (by logging a warning)? I'm tempted to not to, as it's quite harmless other than being less efficient - but who knows is someone finds better reasons to do this.

Currently the test passes because the analyzer isn't used in your schema, so the analyzer is instantiated as a Lucene analyzer, and then it reaches your check.
But if you assign the analyzer to a field in the `Sample` entity, the analyzer will be correctly detected as an Elasticsearch one and the check will be bypassed.

1865	"@Sanne So... This situation is not new,  it's been here since I introduced the elasticsearch profiles.

The elasticsearch-5.0 profile is enabled automatically when the `testElasticsearchVersion` is not defined. I had to do this, because just making this a ""default"" profile means the profile will only be enabled when no other profile is... So, enable ""docs"" and you lose the elasticsearch5 profile :/

Unfortunately, ""a property is not defined"" for Maven means ""not defined explicitly"", and definitions in explicitly enabled profiles do not count. So in your case, you had both the `elasticsearch-2.2` and the `elasticsearch-5.0` profiles enabled, and I suppose the `elasticsearch-5.0` profile defined the `testElasticsearchVersion` property, but `elasticsearch-2.2` defined its own plugin configuration. Which won't work for several reasons.

So, if you want to run 2.0/2.2 tests, you must either:

 * Stick to the instructions in README.md and provide the `testElasticsearchVersion` explicitly:
  ```
   mvn clean install -Pelasticsearch-2.0 -DtestElasticsearchVersion=2.1.0
  ```
 * Or disable the default profile (`elasticsearch-5.0`) explicitly:

For the record, I'm having massive changes locally which I never sent a PR for as I wanted to polish them more; the reality is I'll have to do the work over as I waited too long and it's easier to re-do the work than fixing conflicts. So, lesson learned .. better to merge fast unless it's easy.

I see other similar cases now, like `ElasticsearchDialectProvider`.. I guess you changed direction after we talked more about Services :+1:

1878	"@yrodiere we also use the dist profile in the regular master job.

The dist profile only generates aggregated javadoc so you won't have any issue if this particular javadoc is not included. To be completely thorough, when the aggregated javadoc is built, it builds the javadoc of all the modules but it only reports errors for the modules included in the final output. In the log file of the CI job, you can see there was an error generating the elasticsearch javadoc but as it wasn't included in the aggregated output, it wasn't reported.

In the release job, we use `-DperformRelease=true` to generate the sources jars and the javadoc jars (in HV, they are disabled with an explicit `maven.javadoc.skip` `true` directive).

It should be tested but I'm not sure generating the individual javadocs + the aggregated one will take much more time as it looks like the aggregate task looks for already generated javadoc before generating them. If it's confirmed, we would only have to add `-DperformRelease=true` to the CI job to be on the safe side."	2017-02-22 08:43:30	0.0		1

1969	"I just copy-pasted the phrasing from other properties that have been here for a long time (`SERVER_URI` for instance, but practically every other ES property has a similar phrasing). The example is supposed to make it clear that you can only use `default` and not an index name. But you still have to include `default` because we were expecting to support defining it per index in the future.

I think it's supposed to mirror the phrasing for core Hibernate Search settings, e.g. `org.hibernate.search.cfg.Environment.LOCKING_STRATEGY`:

```
	 * Can be given globally or for specific indexes:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><code>hibernate.search.default.locking_strategy=simple</code></li>
	 * <li><code>hibernate.search.Books.locking_strategy=org.custom.components.MyLockingFactory</code></li>
	 * </ul>
```

Or `org.hibernate.search.cfg.Environment.INDEX_BASE_PROP_NAME`:

```
	 * Option for setting the base directory for storing Lucene indexes when working with file-system based directories.
	 * To be given globally:
	 * <p>
	 * <code>hibernate.search.default.indexBase=/var/lucene/indexes</code>
```

I replaced the current phasing with something like that, without an example:

```
	 * To be given <b>globally</b> only (i.e. prefixed with {@code hibernate.search.default.}).
	 * <b>Cannot</b> be specified per index (e.g. {@code hibernate.search.myIndex.elasticsearch.username}).
	 * This limitation will be removed in a future version of Hibernate Search.

2005	"About the comment: the code actually fetches the analyzer reference from the integrator, so technically the comment is correct. The integrator is not the analyzer provider. Maybe you have a better wording in mind?

The rationale behind override is you mentioned (initially) that we could have a ""default"" provider that would add some common analyzers. If we don't make `@AnalyzerDef` override definitions from the provider, on existing applications the introduction of those default definitions might change analyzer definitions without the users knowing about it. For instance if we introduce a definition for ""standard"" and the user already has an `@AnalyzerDef` named ""standard"".

The other solution would be to forbid analyzer overrides completely (throw an exception), but then again that would mean breaking compatibility with existing code if we have default analyzer definitions.

I have some more perf tests as well, being developed. Will need to tidy them up eventually and share, it's currently a mess of experiments and various branches trying different things, e.g. different combinations of dependencies.

That's a very interesting point. From one side, I agree with you that this shouldn't happen. On the other, I can see how someone needing to ""fine tune"" things might want to do that, so if we ""fix"" it by not doing it, we might need to introduce a specific feature for such a mapping.

you seem to put some special effort to collect all references into a single collection, to then invoke the initialize method on all references at once.

2166	"As far as I can tell, the actual problem is we create new instances of analyzers when dynamically adding new entities, even for analyzers we already discovered. So we end up having multiple references to the same analyzer, pointing to different instances of this analyzer. It's similar for Elasticsearch.
I guess it's not critical, unless you have dozens of analyzers and you dynamically add new entities every two seconds.

This is a pre-existing bug, though, not really the point of this PR. Solving it would require to initialize the `ConfigContext` analyzer registries with the content of the previous version of the search integrator.
Actually I did solve this bug in another branch I'm working on (for other reasons), but that branch is currently blocked because of [an unrelated, ongoing debate over what to do next](http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/hibernate-dev/2017-January/015704.html).

 1. We have analyzer/analyzerReference mixups: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/pull/1263#discussion_r92823889 . @gsmet , my last commit should solve that issue. Does it seem ok to you? 
 2. Whether file parameters should be forwarded as is (and files should exist on the Elasticsearch instance), or we should parse those files and forward their content, adequately formatted in JSON: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/pull/1263#discussion_r92822304
 3. Whether we pass parameters to Elasticsearch-specific analysis factories using a) multiple, small parameters with the same name as in Elasticsearch or b) one big JSON object parameter with a magic name: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/pull/1263#discussion_r92823889 . My opnion is we should leave it as is, but we could also provide both to users and let them choose.

We must return a reference, and we must start the copy from the analyzer itself, because only the analyzer itself (which is specific to the indexing service) knows which type of reference to return. If we returned the analyzer directly, we wouldn't know how to wrap it in a reference...

Here it's not that bad, because we are in a Lucene context, so we could wrap it in a `LuceneAnalyzerReference` and be done with it.

In later commits, we must introduce methods in `ElasticsearchAnalyzer` that are specific to Elasticsearch (or rather, specific to the way the Elasticsearch module handles analyzers). Those methods are not relevant to the engine, so we can't add those in `RemoteAnalyzer` (the superinterface of `ElasticsearchAnalyzer`.

If we keep `ScopedRemoteAnalyzer` in the -engine module, we obviously cannot make it implement methods defined in the Elasticsearch module. But we should, because `ScopedRemoteAnalyzer` is essentially a proxy that should be usable wherever we use a standard analyzer...

That's the point of this whole `is()/`/`unwrap` pattern in this case: we don't use adaptors, so simple `instanceof` and client-side casts would have done the trick. The only reason to implement that pattern is to be a bit cleaner and to be more strict about encapsulation. See `org.hibernate.jpa.spi.AbstractEntityManagerImpl.unwrap(Class<T>)` for instance, it's even more strict than what I propose (it only accepts interface types).

So it may be useful. Now, do we want to support that on Elasticsearch, that's another question. Regarding the type detection in the query DSL, it doesn't seem any different from Lucene to me (there also is a difference between querying strings and numbers). Maybe that's not an issue with Elasticsearch, but a more general one?

As a side note, we do have tickets relative to ""dynamic"" fields, but not directly related to Elasticsearch: [HSEARCH-1379](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1379) and maybe also [HSEARCH-1401](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-1401)"	2016-12-15 08:10:33	1.0	2016-12-18 21:52:45	0

One last attempt of keeping the API part:

* `FieldMetadataCreationContext` is an experimental API and we specify that it is currently under development
* `Elasticsearch` is the equivalent of `FieldMetadataCreationContextImpl`  that it is currently under an impl package. The name should probably be `ElasticsearchFieldMetadataCreationContext` (but it seems too long to me). `ElasticsearchFieldMetadata`?
* FieldMetadataCreationContext is an SPI and not a public API, it also does not mention Elasticsearch in the API but only that mappedOn should return a FieldCreationContext

@Sanne better if you give a look as well.

I'm OK postponing this part, but I would prefer to keep it because the user can startto experiment with it and we have an initial POC before committing to an API

2271	"> Do we have strong use case for this? If there are issues with the emitted strict mapping, we should rather fix those.

What do you mean by issues? Elasticsearch allow to define different fields with different dynamic type properties. So you could specify that all the fields are strict but one of the field is an inner object and the fields in it can change. Maybe this is not the best use case for hibernate search, but there might be other clients that need to access the same index. There is an example in the Elasticsearch documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/dynamic-mapping.html

> The notion of ""object fields"" seems to have a huge impact. It may be justified to add, but it's still a bit blurry to me.

I suspect that the more backends we will have the more fileld types we will need, for example Elasticsearch also support `nested` types. I'm not sure how we want to address this in the future. For this specific case, INNER_OBJECT might be a better name, the javadoc will specify that the mapping can change based on the backend capabilities. "	2016-12-15 09:52:33	1.0	2016-12-18 21:52:45	0

If I understood it correctly, those changes only affect the ```DirectoryBasedIndexManager```, right? 

At least from Infinispan point of view, there are no issues with the ```DirectoryBasedIndexManager``` at the moment since all the stream work is applied synchronously to the index

So even if this PR is merged, the issue of missing documents because the flush was called while async works were not applied to the index when using the ES would still remain, that's what #1246 addresses.

@gustavonalle They do, but the approach is different.

You only have synchronization issues because you send indexing works from multiple nodes, but only flush from one node, so the flush may happen before some indexing works.
You said you had to do this because, with `DirectoryBasedIndexManager`, the flushes would mess with works being executed. I gathered there must be a synchronization issue then, and this PR solves that issue.

Theoretically, after this PR is merged, you'll be able to send a final flush from every node which added asynchronous indexing works, removing the need to explicitly wait for the works to finish executing before flushing.

Mind that the final flushes may have to be executed through `performOperations(List<LuceneWork>, IndexingMonitor`, according to the javadoc:

```
	 * Operations might be applied out-of-order! To mark two series of operations which need to be applied
	 * in order, use a transactional operation between them: a transactional operation will always flush
	 * all streaming operations first, and be applied before subsequent streaming operations.

Your answer: 

> This does not work well for the DirectoryIndexManager: it could lead to cascade failures since flush can be very expensive after inserting a large amount of data. That's why flush is carefully done once. For the Elasticsearch I haven't tested it, but I suppose it could go better since they prevent multiple flushes in parallel.

Right, I overlooked the part where you suggested that on Infinispan we start flushing from every node instead of once after all nodes are done submitting their data.

Thinking about it, this can lead to other undesired issues, let me explain: your changes may prevent multiple expensive flushes at the same time (and thus bringing the whole cluster to its knees, which it's good) but still it'll execute multiple flushes. Imagine a cluster of 100 nodes, each node finishes submitting data at a different point in time (reasonable to assume that, data distribution may not be exactly identical across nodes) and then flushes: the flushes will not be executed in parallel but will happens nonetheless, 100 times. A node that finishes early and flushes will effectively slow down everyone else while it does its (in theory) non required flush, which can decrease throughput of the mass indexing processing.

2357	"> A node that finishes early and flushes will effectively slow down everyone else while it does its (in theory) non required flush, which can decrease throughput of the mass indexing processing.

How I see it, this flush is not required now, but the data it flushes will have to be flushed eventually. And once it's been flushed, well it's that much less to flush at the end.
However, I understand what you mean about performance: worst case we will have 100 flushes, each for 1/100th of the data, which may prevent Lucene to perform some optimizations and may require some of its internal operations to be repeated needlessly. I'd expect a flush with less data to be faster, but 100 consecutive flushes with each 100 times less data may indeed be sub-optimal.

Bottom line: I honestly can't tell how badly this would impact performance without testing it. Let's see what @Sanne thinks about it. The fix might be relevant anyway, even if Infinispan doesn't switch to a ""one-flush-per-node"" strategy, because there really seems to be a synchronization issue (from what you said)."	2016-12-05 15:10:25	0.0		0

I'll try to do that today or tomorrow, but I'm not sure the issue will be easily reproductible.

Technically, this commit makes sure that while doing a flush, we don't try to write to the index. Which could be an issue since the ""flush"" actually commits the index writer, and after that we have to use a new index writer.

The link with HSEARCH-2492 is that HSEARCH-2492 is only relevant in the following scenario:

 * Purge indexes (once)
 * BatchBackend.enqueueAsyncWork (several times)
 * BatchBackend.flush (once)

... And the reason for the last step to be executed only once in a centralized fashion is (presumably) that if one node flushes while another is still indexing, there will be failures because the flush changes the index writer (sets it to null) and the indexing works use that same index writer.

Here, I'm making sure that even if one node flushes while another is still indexing, everything will go smoothly. Which will enable Infinispan to change its scenario to the following:

 * Purge indexes (once)
 * BatchBackend.enqueueAsyncWork (several times in parallel on several nodes)
 * BatchBackend.flush (once at the end, for each node)

And then HSEARCH-2492 is not relevant anymore.

2362	"> Technically, this commit makes sure that while doing a flush, we don't try to write to the index.

That's not a problem, a Lucene IndexWriter is threadsafe. Worst case we'll be including in the flush some changes which didn't *require* the flush: we don't guarantee that changes which don't have an explicit flush will not be flushed yet. For example the write buffers are bounded: when the buffers are full, a flush will be triggered automatically.

> Which could be an issue since the ""flush"" actually commits the index writer, and after that we have to use a new index writer.

We don't have to use a new IndexWriter after a flush - only some configuration actually demand this - yet I don't see the problem as that specific case is driven by +org.hibernate.search.backend.impl.lucene.SharedIndexCommitPolicy+ , which ensures the IW is not closed when it's being used by using reference counting. The one exception I can think of is how OOM exceptions, out of disk, and other critical exceptions are handled, in this case IW might need to be forcefully closed.

2371	"@DavideD Hi! I thought about the TikaBridge a bit this week-end, and I think we have another way out for the container type issues with TikaBridge, without adding yet another bridge interface.
My concern with adding new bridge interfaces is that for every new interface we add, the extent of what a bridge can implement becomes less and less obvious to a newcomer. I know type introspection is useful (and I've done it myself in other PRs), but if we can avoid it, maybe we should?

So, the solution: currently when a return type is a container, we only do one pass on bridge providers, passing a context with getReturnType() returning the element type. What if we did *two* passes? One where the context would hold the container type (a getReturnType method that returns the container type, and a getReturnElementType method that returns the element type), and a second pass that where we would act as usual, with getReturnType returning the element type. We would only do bridge-wrapping with our container wrappers in the second case. This would probably be backward-compatible,  because pre-existing bridge providers would give up on the first pass (""I don't support Collection""), and everything would be like it used to be on the second pass.

What do you think?"	2016-12-05 09:08:27	0.0		1
2372	"@DavideD Actually the interface has the added benefit of also working on field bridges created because of explicit annotations (`@FieldBridge(impl = MyContainerBridge.class)`). So it's probably better. I'll wait for your opinion before merging...

The `TikaBridge` issue was with bridge providers getting the wrong metadata, but with HSEARCH-2419 fixed, the issue will also be there at runtime: people that designed custom field bridges for collections will have their bridge wrapped in an `IterableBridge` (for instance) without them knowing, which will probably result in their field throwing a `ClassCastException` when indexing (they'll be passed an element instead of the whole collection).
Introducing the new `ContainerAwareBridge` interface offers a solution to users experiencing this issue, but I wonder how we should advertise this interface, especially because it'll be needed in 5.6 while it wasn't in 5.5..."	2016-12-05 10:27:02	0.0		1
2373	">  wonder how we should advertise this interface

I'm not sure I understand your remarks...

This interface overrides the default behaviours for containers bridges. The default behaviour is to index the elements of a container and if you instead want to index the whole container you can use this interface.

> especially because it'll be needed in 5.6 while it wasn't in 5.5...

That's not true, TikaBridge does not work in 5.5 with byte[] arrays anyway. You just have a different error. Adding this interface doesn't affect what was working on 5.5...unless I'm missing something."	2016-12-05 11:09:20	0.0		0
2374	To be fair, I didn't check if it works with 5.5 but given the nature of the problem I assume it doesn't work with it. I might be wrong	2016-12-05 11:17:43	0.0		0
2375	"@DavideD Let me clarify: there are two different issues.

The first is the one you're addressing, with bridge providers. Bridge providers were being passed a context that returns the element type, and gives no information about the actual type of objects that will be passed to the bridge in `set(String name, Object value, Document document, LuceneOptions options)`. That made the `TikaBridgeProvider` fail for `byte[]` because `byte` was passed, and it didn't support `byte`, only `byte[]`.

But there is another, nastier issue here.

We used to pass the element type instead of the actual property type because we usually wrap provided bridges within an `ArrayBridge`, `IterableBridge` and so on. That's what is done in `BridgeFactory#getFieldBridgeFromBridgeProvider`. So the bridge providers need not know about the actual container type, we handle it for them and only pass them the elements, one after another.

That the theory, but in practice it didn't work until we fixed HSEARCH-2419 (or at least not in every case: I'll spare you the details). So until we fixed HSEARCH-2419 , bridges applied on container types (arrays, iterables, maps) were actually being passed the container when indexing with `set(String name, Object value, Document document, LuceneOptions options)`. So there are users out there (I know some) that built field bridges that supported containers well before, and it used to work.

So... now that we fixed `HSEARCH-2419`, those bridges will now be wrapped in our container bridges (as they should have been from the beginning), and will now get passed container *elements* in `set(String name, Object value, Document document, LuceneOptions options)`. Since they're expecting containers, they'll fail when trying to cast the value to a container.

This means that their code that used in 5.5 (because HSEARCH-2419 hadn't been fixed) won't work in 5.6 anymore.

Your interface would solve this second issue, because custom bridges supporting containers would only have to implement this interface. But still, it requires users to do something, and that's why I wondered ""how we should advertise this interface"".

Is it clearer?"	2016-12-05 11:27:49	0.0		1
2376	"The FieldBridge contract is very vague about which value is going to be index, we should probably take the chance to decide the correct behaviour and add some tests for it. Users will need to update their bridges this time if they used a different behaviour.

That said, unless we still require the @IndexEmbedded annotation I don't see how we can know if the user wants to index the container or the element and still keep back-compatibility.  This would mean revert some of the changes and post-pone them after 5.6.

I would treat all this as a follow up issue, though. As it requires some additional discussion how to address it. In particular, I would expect to receive the whole object when I create a custom field bridge and not the element (current default behaviour).

 * the query descriptors themselves may be created from public static methods (such as `org.hibernate.search.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchQueries.fromJson(String)`), making it impossible to pass a reference to the service when creating the query descriptor.

What I can do is:

 * request the reference only once in the `ElasticsearchHSQuery` constructor, which is not much better since queries are generally only executed once or twice. 
 * replace the GsonService by static methods, but I did exactly the opposite a few months ago, so that would be a shame.
 * maybe see why requesting a reference to a service is such a performance issue? Especially given we have a cache...

Also, I'd like to mention two facts:

 1. We already request a reference to a service each time we create a query through `org.hibernate.search.engine.impl.ImmutableSearchFactory.createHSQuery(Query, Class<?>...)` (provided Elasticsearch is being used)

Couldn't we use plain `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock`s under the hood instead of our own counters here? That way, we'd have a read lock (that would ensure nobody is going to start/stop a service while it's being used) and a write lock (that would ensure we're free to start/stop a service without breaking anyone else).

2388	"We can do many things, but it will always be more efficient to start all needed services at boot time, and stop them ""at the end"". Incidentally, the ServiceWrapper could be made more efficient for parallel runtime access, but that would come at other costs which I don't think we should be paying. For example, I wouldn't assume that using a ""plain Lock"" would be better than the current code.

Think in terms of limits: what would happen on a single threaded app? For every single query, we'd be starting the service, then stopping it again. For some services this *might* be cheap, but for others it will not, it will at very least be allocating several objects which we don't have to.

If you prefer we can resolve that later, but bear with me that I'd expect the ""perfect version"" of the code to not stop/start services at runtime, unless there's specific reasonable need. For example we'll have to live with the fact that a Service might need to be started lazily in reaction of starting a new IndexManager, for example started lazily by a dynamic sharding request to expand.

2389	"> Think in terms of limits: what would happen on a single threaded app? For every single query, we'd be starting the service, then stopping it again.

Ok, that not what I had in mind. It's true in the general case, though even in a single threaded app, `GsonService` is likely to be referenced elsewhere, so it likely wouldn't be started for each query. It is for instance referenced by `org.hibernate.search.elasticsearch.client.impl.JestClient`, which is referenced (indirectly) by `ElasticsearchIndexManager`, whose lifespan is large enough to make this start/stop dance quite rare.

Anyway... We're both willing to avoid this potential performance issue here. I'll simply repeat what I said yesterday: in that particular case, there's no single, non-service object created when bootstrapping that could hold the reference to this service and pass it along to queries at runtime. I would _like_ to do so, but it's simply not possible in the current state of the code. Or at least I'm unable to see how it's possible. Which is why I'm trying to think of alternative solutions...

I created a ticket to address potential performance issues in the `ServiceManager` for those few cases where we are forced to repeatedly acquire reference to services. We should avoid it, I agree, but there may be cases where we can't do otherwise. See https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2504"	2016-12-06 09:23:08	0.0		0

I'm really not sure the `unwrap(Class<?>)` pattern fits here, though. It feels rather clumsy in our case, mostly because bridges have no common superinterface exposing the unwrap(?)` method, so we must rely on utils anyway whenever we want to unwrap bridges. This is true for client code (metadata processor and such), but also for the implementation of the `unwrap(Class<?>)` method itself... 

So if we have to use utils, we might as well make the `unwrap` code in bridges as simple as possible and stick to its previous form.

2439	"Looks like I have to explain a bit of the intent behind _performStreamOperation_, sorry for the lack of clear documentation.

Once upon a time, the MassIndexer would use its own dedicated IndexWriter. This implies that when the MassIndexer was running, any other change to the index would be blocked in wait for the index lock to be released.
The IndexWriter backend of the MassIndexer was different than the one being used by the ""transactional backend"": it would apply changes in parallel (no ordering guarantees) and no flushing between writes, while the traditional one would apply a ""block"" (a batch?) of changes at a time, to maintain strict order, and commit the IW at the end of each block.

We introduced the _performStreamOperation_ as a way to ""sneak by"" the changes required by the MassIndexer on the same IW already (possibly) open by the standard IW backend, bypassing the ""one change at a time"" requirement of the normal backend while reusing the same IW instance.
In practice this needed (and needs!) some care, as now we had two incoming streams of changes on the same IW, with subtly different semantics. N.B. it is not an option to simply apply the strongest required semantics, as otherwise the performance penalty is unacceptable (like taking 1 month rather than 1 minute to do certain operations).

The main flaw of the current design, is that the conceptual ""streams"" have no starting point and no end; the Flush command for example is needed by the MassIndexer to signal for the phase of ""I've sent a bunch of stream commands, now I'm done so now I want you to finally flush to disk.."" This is actually a very tricky point, as the previous ""stream ops"" being applied in parallel need to be strictly ordered all before the flush.

I hope that clarifies the *original* intent of the _performStreamOperation_ method. We should likely rethink such things now, as it all looks quite obsolete when combined with many other changes we applied to the backend. For example I wonder if we should explicitly open/close ""stream tasks"", making the explicit Flush command unnecessary, or rather separate the high level flush concept from actual index commits, which should be a backend implementation detail.

On this PR now: 

My main question is why are you testing semantics of _performStreamOperation_ ? Is Infinispan using this for anything else than the MassIndexer?

Keep in mind that the MassIndexer is the only one which is meant to use this method, and it's assumed to never produce more than one entry for the same ID. Your test intentionally violates this property .. in other words, the _performStreamOperation_ might have an ill name and I'm sorry for that but it doesn't guarantee ordering within the ""stream"", as it expects a stream of *unrelated* data points.

Let's also keep https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2282 in mind!

Infinispan's MassIndexer uses a ```org.hibernate.search.backend.spi.BatchBackend``` that in turn ends up calling this method. The test just does the same.

Indeed. Bear in mind that the  ```DirectoryBasedIndexManager``` [doesn't have](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/blob/master/engine/src/main/java/org/hibernate/search/indexes/spi/DirectoryBasedIndexManager.java#L102) a ""async stream"" mode currently, ```forceAsync``` is ignored. But the ```ElasticsearchIndexManager``` does have it and it is now the default on master. Making it ```sync``` as this PR does is up for discussion, and the fact that both index managers behave differently causes some issues https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2492.

IMO, an ```async``` default would need an improved API, either exposing something to detect if there is any ""in-flight"" changes not applied to index  (so that my flush will actually flush), or maybe return a ```Future```

2452	"Short story:

I left it ```false``` to maintain the behaviour currently in place: all work is async by default, so ```forceAsync``` is not used as before.

Long Story:

This is what the contract says about this flag:
```
@param forceAsync if true, the invocation will not block to wait for it being applied. 
When false this will depend on the backend configuration.
```

In the ```DirectotyBasedIndexManager``` there is a configuration ```worker.execution``` which assumes values ```{sync,async}``` that defines how works are applied to the index. In theory, the ```forceAsync``` flag should have no effect if the backend is already async. So assuming ```worker.execution=async``` and ```forceAsync=false```, what should happen? Having ```!forceAsync``` would make it sync... :disappointed: 

You may be asking why does it matter since the ```ElasticsearchIndexManager``` does not honor ```worker.execution```?  Should it honor it?

The thing is, we used to use HashMap/HashSet, whose iteration order is notoriously unstable (it might change when you add new elements). But this iteration order is important: it determines in which order fields are added to a document, or in which order fields are added to the Elasticsearch mapping. And in some cases (most notably indexing in Elasticsearch), the order in which fields are added to the JSON document may change the code that is executed.

And so it happens that, in https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/commit/e5382aaced0d9d9e4ba0361e3473a58428f88936, I fixed two aspects of the same bug. As a matter of fact, there are two places where we might change the JSON document when indexing:

 * [explicitly](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/commit/e5382aaced0d9d9e4ba0361e3473a58428f88936#diff-5c25139bd711d1dae0c48d6d1fa00536R65): when we add a property value to the JSON document. The `add` method seems a bit odd, but it's only so that we can support multi-valued fields,even though this information that a field is multi-valued is not part of our metadata.
 * [implicitly](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/commit/e5382aaced0d9d9e4ba0361e3473a58428f88936#diff-5c25139bd711d1dae0c48d6d1fa00536R79): when we implicitly create parent properties. For instance when we add a value for the property `foo.bar`, then `foo` has to be added to the JSON document as an object property, so we can set `bar` on it. This is done under the hood, but it is a document modification. And it does not follow the same rules as the ""explicit"" change, since multi-values are not at all supported in this case.

Thus, since there are two different places in the code where we change a document, there are two places where a field naming conflict could be detected. Which is why we have two error cases:

 1. when, for the the same field name, first an explicit change is performed (`add` sets a ""concrete"" value such as an integer, a date, etc. for field `foo`), and then an implicit one (`getOrCreate` tries to set a composite value, i.e. a JSON object for field `foo` in order to add the field `foo.bar`): https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/commit/36cee0230910c124192c983b5e68e4215bb71ffd#diff-92dcdf2c51f954af5389442b38ba3de7R176
 2. when the changes happen in reverse order (first the implicit `getOrCreate`, then the explicit `add`): https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/commit/36cee0230910c124192c983b5e68e4215bb71ffd#diff-92dcdf2c51f954af5389442b38ba3de7R208

Now, one can understand that if the iteration order over the fields is unpredictable, I can hardly test those two cases, because I won't have any guarantee on which field is added to the JSON document first, and so I won't be able to ensure I am in case 1 or in case 2.

That's where the map/set implementation come in play: by using `LinkedHashSet` and `LinkedHashMap`, I ensure that the metadata order is the same as the processing order in the `AnnotationMetadataProcessor`. Thus the metadata order becomes predictable to some extent. Not totally predictable, since we still rely on the order of the fields/methods returned by the JVM (which is undefined and not even guaranteed to be deterministic), but partially predictable: I can be sure, for instance, that `@Fields` on methods will appear in the metadata before `@Field` on attributes, because methods are processed first.

On a related subject, I don't find the reliance on a particular map/set implementation _that_ smelly. At least, not anymore than Java is smelly: the contract of `Set` and `Map` does not mention that the iteration order should be stable, so it's up to the implementation. I would gladly use the `StableSet` and `StableMap` interfaces, but there is no such thing.
`SortedSet` and `SortedMap` are not exactly what we want, because their only implementations (`TreeSet` and `TreeMap`) require a total order on the elements we add to these containers, and in this case we don't have one. Given two fields, we could order them by their field name, but what if two different `DocumentFieldMetadata` have the same name? They're not identical, but there's no way to say which one is ""greater"". And yes, this can happen, most notably [when class bridges are defined without a field name](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-search/commit/fc304a32133d07829eb542a7e85e4fe3b1c438bb)."	2016-11-29 08:54:11	0.0		1

I agree relying on the source document is far from ideal, but right now it's the only way to support projections properly (as I explained in the paragraph starting with ""Reminder:""). But yes, we could introduce a global parameter allowing users to use field storage for projections, and document the limitations.

Also, I wonder if the whole executor + readLock + writeLock stuff shouldn't be encapsulated in a separate object... What I find dangerous is that just after we copied the executor, one could call `shutdown` on a previous `LuceneBackendResources`, which would shut down the executor but would not clean up the `asyncIndexingExecutor` attribute on any new `LuceneBackendResources` that happened to share the same executor. And then we would have tasks being submitted but never handled.

Having a single, shared object hold the references to the locks would *and* to the executor would probably solve the issue. Then, when starting or shutting down the executor, we wouldn't change an attribute of `LuceneBackendResources`, but an attribute of that single, shared object that happens to be referenced from `LuceneBackendResources`, which is slightly different.

This solution is a bit more twisted when it comes to calling the monitor, but otherwise it seems fine (it's even ready for when we'll add methods to `IndexMonitor`) and it should work just as well.

### Details:

I didn't move the loop to the handler, because the handler was specific to each backend request, and even the monitor it delegated to was specific to each backend request (theoretically, you may have two backend requests in the same bulk that have a different monitor).

Even if that wasn't an issue, tying the handler to the bulk instead of tying it to the backend request would have forced me to include action-specific code in the handler (to distinguish actions that require incrementing the monitor, like `Update` from those that don't, like `Delete`).

2514	"The `IndexingMonitor` can become a contention point when it's invoked too frequently, for example when running on servers with many CPUs, one `MassIndexer` job will use them all in parallel, and the pattern is relatively efficient because it attempts to not share much; the monitor is one of the exceptions.

For this reason it takes a `long` argument, so that its counters can be incremented by values larger than one; so I would expect a Bulk Request not cause invoking the `IndexingMonitor#documentsAdded( 1L )` method N times, but invoke it with a parameter N.

On the other hand, I like your idea of having the `handle` method to accept the `BulkResultItem` argument. 
Could you move this loop into the `BackendRequestSuccessHandler` implementation? There it can inspect the bulk result, and invoke the `IndexingMonitor` once as necessary.

- I only do as little double boxing as possible (see the last commit)

The sort behavior is unchanged: entities without coordinates are considered furthest by default. It seems to me that it should stay that way for now: it's more or less consistent with the previous behavior (which used the distance to (0,0), which for most coordinates is a large distance).
By the way, the fact that we now return null for projections is likely to trigger NPEs in some applications... Maybe we should postpone that last commit to Hibernate Search 6.0?

Yes. On Infinispan, during topology changes, there is a small time window where a lock obtention fails due to transient ownership changes, and my custom error handler catches that and redirect the work to the rightful owner.

Which I find far more unappealing than adding that flag in the current metadata.
Note that it's not an issue of duplicating code (we only use the encoding in one place, it seems), but really more an issue of re-executing bootstrap code again and again at runtime.

Anyway, you're telling me ""we need to break free of Lucene dependency"", and that's definitely not the purpose of this PR, but more of 6.0.

Anyway, @gsmet: I just updated the last two commits following your comments. I didn't rename the `documentFieldMetadata`/`documentFieldNameToFieldMetadata` properties to make it more obvious that they don't include non-embedded fields, because if I did, I should rename almost every property in `TypeMetadata`: none of them includes embedded information along with the main type's information.

- It seems to me that, if the tenant ID contains an underscore, there will still be a problem (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2420)

Same as now: the actual document ID (as opposed to the entity ID), which is the concatenation of the tenant ID and the entity ID. Its main purpose is to allow ES to know when an update should erase an existing document.
It would only be of use to Hibernate Search when querying by entity ID (using ES's ""_id"" queries), but this type of query is not implemented yet. Right know, users can only query on the document fields (which include the tenant ID and the entity ID in separate fields anyway).

2721	"Right, in this case if there is a concurrent request it's preferrable to have a thread wait on the synchronization's lock rather than doing multiple IO operations to attempt to open multiple readers (and then have to close and discard one of them).

Think of it in terms of spent resources: if you lock, the thread will be parked and CPU time assigned to do something useful on a different thread. The cost is if course that your current thread will have to wait N milliseconds, were N is the time for the other thread to complete the indexreader refresh.

In the alternative strategy, using a putIfAbsent, the thread will not hit the lock but it will have to perform the same IO operations, which will take it N milliseconds to do (as it's the same operation as in the previous case).

So if you compare the two scenarios, while the lock might looks like ""contention"", it actually frees the CPU but does less IO, and takes the take time for the client to actually get an IndexReader.

So that's why I choose for the synchronized block.

See also the comment on `usageCounter`.

Also on the method `refreshIfNeeded()` you'll see that the no-longer-current IndexReader is closed - yet this simply means that its usage counter is decremented, so that if any query is still using it it won't actually be closed, but it will only be closed when the last query which is using it will be closed.

2739	"@gsmet I don't know what extra parameter you're talking about, so I guess I didn't take care of this.
Are you talking about the ""nested"" datatype in Elasticsearch? Because I didn't tackle this issue at all.

I simply made sure that when we index fields, we use the field path (concatenated `@IndexedEmbedded` prefixes) instead of using the property path (Java properties) like we used to, which failed miserably as soon as an `@IndexedEmbedded` had a custom prefix. So in fact, I just made sure that the JSON we send to ES for indexing has a structure that matches mapping we defined.

2740	"I might be wrong but reading the commit comments, I understood that you might have used nested fields to deal with embedded.

It's probably the way to go but it has consequences. This was an open issue in our current implementation, we haven't taken good care of it (see `ToElasticSearch#isNested` for instance).

See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-sort.html#nested-sorting for information on nested sorting.

2741	"Thanks for the piece of information. From what I read, this applies to the nested datatype (""In the below example offer is a field of type nested"").

One thing to note is that when indexing, you can pass arrays for any field (including `object` fields), but they get flattened internally. So you can nest without using the `nested` datatype. The `nested` datatype brings more subtle behavior, which (I guess) is why special care should be taken when sorting.

Currently every `IndexedEmbedded` path component is mapped to the `object` datatype: see `org.hibernate.search.elasticsearch.impl.ElasticsearchIndexManager.getOrCreateProperties(JsonObject, String)`, the JsonObject have no `type` properties, and the default is `object`. I did not change anything to the mapping, I just made sure we produce correct JSON documents when indexing. 

From what I can see, https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-2263 relates more closely to the issue you're mentioning. But I agree we'll have to address that one, too.

2794	"This marker is useful when `@IndexedEmbedded` collections are indexed.

For instance:

``` java
@Indexed
public class MyEntity {
@IndexedEmbedded(indexNullAs = ""NULL"")
private List<String> myCollection;
}
```

When `myCollection` contains `[""foo"", ""bar""]`, the following fields will appear in the Lucene document:

```
myCollection:foo
myCollection:bar
```

When `myCollection` is `null`, the following field will appear:

```
myCollection:NULL
```

When you're in the second case you cannot know only from the Lucene document whether the field represents a collection element (say, `myCollection[1]` in pseudo-code) or the collection itself (still in pseudo-code, `myCollection`, or `myCollection.this` to be more explicit).

""This"" or ""self"" are the only words that came to my mind and seemed to fit the meaning of this marker: it states that the field value is not the value of a collection element, but really the value of the embedded itself.

Be aware, though, that in order to fix HSEARCH-2397 I'm already refactoring this: just using a string for the nesting path is not enough, the marker has to convey more information. So it might not be worth a long discussion...

My last question is on the names of the def members; I've used the same names for the simple version (accepting Strings) and the overloaded more powerful version (accepting TagDef / AttributeDef). Whereas in the annotations we have to use different names as we cannot overload the methods there.

Sorry for not answering earlier, I was busy preparing the Beta1 of HV 6 and didn't have a chance to review this before.

I added a couple of commits, mostly to avoid instantiating new objects and be consistent with the rest of the code.

As for the tests for positive/negative, I added tests in the TCK, that's why there weren't any tests in HV. I'll include them for now but I might remove them later when I will review the TCK tests.

I  followed your advice about `AnnotationDef`. And here's what I've done. I moved some parts from `ConstraintDef` to `AnnotationDef` and extended from it, as `ConstraintDef` is an annotation as well, right? 

I also added `annotationsAsParameters` to  `AnnotationDef`, it contains those annotation parameters which are annotations themselves. I moved `createAnnotationProxy` to `AnnotationDef` as it looked as a better place for it.

The only thing that I'd like to improve is to cover a case when parameter is not an array of annotations but a single annotation. Right now there seems to be no such cases, but I'd like to add it so the functionality is more complete. So if in general the approach is fine - I'll add this additional functionality for single annotation."	2017-05-04 07:14:17	0.0		0

The new ``AnnotationDef`` would be transformed to annotation proxies in `ConfiguredConstraint#createAnnotationProxy()` (e.g. you would need to special case if the value is an `AnnotationDef` and recurse into it).

The overall idea is:
 * to avoid unneeded instantiations

2855	"@marko-bekhta @gsmet Can you take a look at this PR: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/pull/739. It's based on your's but takes a slightly different approach for handling the inner types of `@SafeHtml` in the API. Instead of having one fluent invocation on one level this adds `new TagDef()` and new `AttributeDef()` for those. For the common case of no further configuration on the next level, an overloaded version of just taking a string is added.

It's failing the test, i.e. I must have done something wrong within the implementation, but before going further I wanted to share it with you to discuss on the API. I like that it makes clearer, when one element has been fully configured as opposed to one huge fluent invocation. WDYT?"	2017-05-16 08:48:52	0.0		1

2862	"> The only difference that I've found is that in other cases list annotations are using arrays to declare list elements. And when I changed MixDirectAnnotationAndListContainerAnnotation to do the same - it helped

Ah ah, I also played the Spot the 7 differences game but didn't find this one...

So I suppose it's a bug in JDK 8 fixed in JDK 9.

I would be for just fixing the test. People using `List` will have multiple annotations in it (or they won't need it anyway). I think it's sufficiently a corner case so that we ignore it, especially because it's fixed in the next JDK version.

I just wanted to have stable tests for JDK 8 and 9 so let's just add the braces and leave with it.

As for the check itself.. I'd say that there's still something that we can improve. In next case:
```java
@Length(min = 5)
@Length.List({
		@Length(min = 45),
		@Length(min = 46),
		@Length(min = 47)
})
@Target({ ANNOTATION_TYPE, METHOD, CONSTRUCTOR })
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Constraint(validatedBy = MixDirectAnnotationAndListContainerAnnotation.MixDirectAnnotationAndListContainerAnnotationValidator.class)
@Documented
public @interface MixDirectAnnotationAndListContainerAnnotation {
```
AP will report 3 errors for each `@Length(min = 45)`, `@Length(min = 46)`, `@Length(min = 47)` that there's a mix of `@Length(min = 5)` and `@Length.List(...`

2948	"Hmmmm. So it hurts to say that **again** but Gunnar was probably right from the beginning :).

If we end up having to use a regexp, we probably use the wrong tool (or in this case, I think the tool is not very well designed for its purpose).

Could you take a look at https://github.com/policeman-tools/forbidden-apis ? Looks like the signature file format is simple: https://github.com/policeman-tools/forbidden-apis/blob/master/src/main/resources/de/thetaphi/forbiddenapis/signatures/jdk-deprecated-1.6.txt . You can disable a method or a class. If it makes a better work, we should use it instead. Note that in passing, we might be able to have less checkstyle configuration files as at least one of them is just to enable JUnit for parts where we rely on JUnit. Note that even if we use JUnit, we should disable the `AssertJUnit` class so maybe we need one signature file for generally disabled API (might be handy in the future) and one for JUnit that we enable only for projects relying on TestNG.

I was a bit worried about how we would share the signature files but it looks like we can reference a file in a jar even if not documented (so we could put the necessary signature files in the build-config jar).

2950	"Sooooooo :) here's what I've done:

- Configured forbidden-api plugin with some bundled signature files (`jdk-unsafe`, `jdk-deprecated`, `jdk-non-portable`)
- Removed checkstyle rule for `System.out` and replaced it with forbidden-api bundled `jdk-system-out`
- Added `SuppressForbidden` annotation, so it can be used to suppress some ""illegal"" classes and methods where it's really needed. Not sure that I've chosen the best place for it though ...
- Removed all different checkstyle configurations and left only one with all the rules
- Removed license header checks from checkstyle configs (so there can be one checkstyle config for all modules) and replaced those checks with `license-maven-plugin`. Also added headers for files that were missing them
- Added `maven-remote-resources-plugin` so that all config related resources from build-config module can be easily used in configurations of other plugins.
- Also did some ""cleaning"" of issues reported by forbidden-apis plugin. Most of them are using something without specifying Locale/TimeZone/Charset "	2017-03-25 21:49:02	0.0		0

One thing I also fixed is that you can't use the maven-remote-resources plugin to get the license resources in the parent pom as build-config might not be deployed yet (or might not contain the resources if it's an old version). I included this in your commit.

Alternatively, one could split it up into `typeArgument()` (generic containers) and `componentType()` (arrays). The names would be a bit better to comprehend, but both would do the same, so I don't like it too much.

Note my considerations are primarily driven by applying the same concepts/names to the spec XML schema, hence the extensive consideration.

                .parameter( 1 )

Going straight to a method parameter doesn't make sense of course. I'm sure it could be resolved (by having multiple `ContainerElementConstraintMappingContext` interfaces, one for property/parameter/return-value.

But I couldn't make it work impl-wise so I gave up on this eventually (a runtime exception is raised when calling the methods in an unsupported location). Should someone else have the energy to give it a try, I'd be happy to merge it as a follow-up, otherwise I think it's good enough.

So I tend to agree that splitting it would make the names clearer but as it's the exact same thing, it feels weird to have 2 different names. So I concur with you that keeping one name is better.

Yes, that was done recently. That area is still in flux, see [our discussion](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jigsaw-dev/2017-February/011320.html) on the jigsaw-dev mailing list.

On the style, thanks a ton for coming up with that stylesheet!

The only issue I see is that the dividers between table column/rows have gone (here are the [current docs](http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/api/) for a comparison). Any chance to add that? At least vertical ones may look a tad better.

And one super-minor thing: when entering something into the search box in the upper right, the results overlay still has the stock-blue header. Maybe this could get a brownish color so to fit better with the rest of theme?

Didn't check the stylesheet but I disagree on moving finalName to the build level. It has nothing to do here. There's something weird with your IDE :).

- move the add-modules stuff to a different commit as I don't think we will commit that for now

@gsmet Ok, I'll do that :) as for the `finalName` it's how IDE is reading the pom file and validation it with the xsd schema. I've looked here - https://maven.apache.org/pom.html and <build> has a finalName in it:
```
 <build>
    <directory>${project.basedir}/target</directory>
    <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/classes</outputDirectory>

comprehensible. But it's no problem. Sorry for all the questions, just
trying to make sure I understand what's going on.

I've found the following to be the best approach for dealing with this kind
of changes:

* Create a first commit with the original file, unaltered (i.e. commit the
default Java 9 stylesheet.css)
* Apply the actual modifications in a separate commit
* Don't apply any re-formatting (or, if you really, really have to, do it
in a separate commit between the initial one and the one with the actual
changes)

This allows to understand the actual changes later on, e.g. allowing it to
re-apply them another time, if the underlying base has changed.

No worries, though. I'll take care of it.

3164	"I've read through the discussion - 
I wasn't able to think of anything better for Period than what you've seen as you were saying that there's no way to say what is a larger period 2 month or 60 days (so I can only see that option of allowing users to determine how long is the month). But in general - I would say that if an object itself cannot be compared to another in one way we should not be adding a constraint for it. So +1 for having Duration only.

As for the duration - as you were saying it doesn't seem to be very readable to have just one unit and would be better to be able to put something like `@MinDuration(minutes=5 , seconds=3)`. But in that case we would need to put a parameter for all `ChronoUnit`s (or at least for all smaller ones). I think it'll be not good if for example we have only `hours` `minutes` and `seconds` but no `milliseconds` or `nanoseconds`.
Because what if you have a duration of 1:11:12.123456 ? you wouldn't be able to specify it right ?

So on the one hand - having only one `ChronoUnit` is not very readable, on the other hand we would need to add a lot of annotation parameters. I really don't have a strong opinion on which option is better so I'll just trust your judgment on this one :)"	2017-02-09 10:33:13	0.0		0

It's a bit more verbose but it's always a pain to specify duration in only one units. I did that a lot in property files and it's really a pain to convert the values in your head."	2017-02-09 10:39:38	0.0		1

Looks nice but I'm not very fond of us maintaining a list of currencies in the long time. I agree it does not change a lot but it does change. i'm also wondering if it may be possible to register other currencies in Moneta, which would make null and void the whole approach.

One thing we could consider is to obtain the list of currencies exposed by the JDK itself (check out `java.util.Currency.getAvailableCurrencies()`, but it still wouldn't accomodate for the case of a custom currency provider implementation.

Overall it looks great, very clean. There are a few really strange issues, though. If the previous PDF wasn't perfect either, I agree we can ship the PDF as is, but otherwise we may want to look at it a bit...

The main issues:
 * Borders for code examples seem to generate strange artifacts when there is a page break just before. See for instance the bottom of pages 55, 62, 97 and 112.
 * Is there any way to tune page breaks? Or to tune the font size for code examples so that they fit better? Sometimes its a bit weird:
   * Pages 18-19, I would have put the page break just before the ""2.1.5"" title
   * Page 97, I think scaling down the font size just a bit would make the code example fit inside the page.

The nitpicking:

 * I find the margins aggressively small, but maybe it's just me
 * Some images seem way too big to fit one page: I noticed page 96, but maybe there are others.

The weird thing is that in optaplanner-docs, I have plenty of big images that get scaled down to fit nicely, but in another project (same asciidoc versions, some config etc), I couldn't get the big images to scale down to fit, even with playing with that param.

3410	"So I've finally made a few more changes :). Now it should catch more invalid cases. I can't see other way than having two methods (one for email another for URLs) to validate domain part, as for the email IPv4 should be in `[]` and for URL it shouldn't (also for IPv6 for email it should be like `[IPv6:SOME_IP_GOES_HERE]`, and for URL - IPv6 is just in `[]`). 

Another question is about dotless domains. Even though they are prohibited (see [here](https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2013-08-30-en)) for example emails with such domains are considered ""valid"" (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address)). If we disallow such domains in that case URL validation for files fails. From one of the cases present in tests - for `file://Users/foobar/tmp` the ""host"" part is `Users` and it is dotless. Should we leave it as is? Or should we do something about it ? WDYT?

I also added a simple valid/invalid IPv6 case, as these were missing for the URLs.

- first, we provide a way to inject a specific `ExpressionFactory` and believe it or not, the one we passed to `StandardELContext` is not used, except to initialize the `StreamELResolver` (see the constructor of `StandardELContext`). See ELContext#convertToType to see how it defaults to the static one if it is not found in the context. So if we want to be sure it's used, we need to put it in the context.
- the second reason is that, with a `StandardELContext`, we instantiate new resolvers for each interpolation, while they are stateless and can be shared.

Quick question: did you analyze the change you made or did you just change `newHashSet` to `newLinkedHashSet` everywhere? Same for `asSet`.

`LinkedHashSet` consumes slightly more memory so we should evaluate this change for each use case e.g. do it only when we want to maintain the order.

That being said, we are heading towards adding more order to constraints evaluation (see http://beanvalidation.org/proposals/BVAL-248/) so it would make sense to keep the order of `ConstraintViolation`s - even if the annotation order was not guaranteed.

3470	"Hi @gsmet,

thanks a lot for your feedback. At first I tried to just change `newHashSet`s which do effect the ordering - but I wasn't sure if I wasn't missing some (I am not 100% familiar with the source). I did some testing and found out I did miss some so I just went ahead and changed everything. I thought the impact is so minimal it maybe doesn't matter and maybe we can just completly switch to `LinkedHashSet`. Like make it a policy ""Use `LinkedHashSet` everywere, never use `HashSet`"" so we are sure order is kept everywhere. As in my initial comment I think/thougt about to also change the remaining `HashSet` in the tests to `LinkedHashSet`s as well to make this a consistent policy.

If you don't agree just switching to `LinkedHashSet`s maybe you want to take half an hour and go through my changes and comment which lines you think is ok to stay `HashSet`s. I could have a look at this after the weekend as well.

Also do you have any memory benchmarks on switching to `LinkedHashSet`s? What's the real life impact? Is it that bad?"	2016-12-17 13:26:17	0.0		1

Keeping an order of the constraints is one of the issues being discussed for BV 2.0 (see the [BVAL-248 proposal](http://beanvalidation.org/proposals/BVAL-248/) for the discussions that happened so far). I think we should first converge on this at the spec level before putting an implementation in place. My concern is that people would rely on the behavior of such ad-hoc implementation, resulting in portability issues, not the least when moving to the BV 2.0 solution proper.

That being said, I'm not fully sure whether the conclusions in the SO answer you linked are correct. There's a lot of implicitness in there :) It'd be great to have confirmation from the JDK team that there indeed is a reliable order (apart from the one for repeatable annotations, which most of the SO discussion relates to) and that they are committing to retain that."	2016-12-19 09:41:49	0.0		1

3544	That thing is nightmare-ish. It works for the general case now, but eventually, the logic would have to be refined.

That said, the entire contract needs to change anyways, it needs to be more generic. That's one of the next things to look into.

3553	It currently is important, but eventually it shouldn't be. In the end I think we need to keep the most specific extractor per type parameter, e.g. if we have an extractor for `Iterable<@ExtractedValue E` and one for `List<@ExtractedValue E` and the validated value is an `ArrayList`, only keep the latter. But I didn't get there yet. Currently it will simply keep the first extractor found per type variable, hence the order of insertion in the constructor is relevant. It's a hack to make things work a bit.	2016-12-01 11:26:27	1.0	2016-12-21 15:38:01	0
3554	OK, additional comment (but probably useless if it goes away): as you inversed the order of key and value in `mapValue`, I think you should do the same for `listValue` and have the index as second parameter. It would be more consistent.	2016-12-01 12:11:05	1.0	2016-12-21 15:38:01	1

3556	It currently works because we only will take the first extractor found per type parameter (see the `containsKey()` call above).

3630	"Hi @gunnarmorling ! Well so here's how I see this:
1. create a `JandexMetaDataProvider` (some code is already present) which will receive jandex index and go through classes/interfaces and look for constraints.
2. to create `BeanConfiguration`s there will be a set of builders (similar to what is present for `XmlMetaDataProvider`). Currently I've started to work on `ConstrainedFieldJandexBuilder`. It seems to me that these builders will have a few methods in common so most likely there will be one abstract and a few implementations for Type, Field, Method, Constructor
3. with having a way to create `BeanConfiguration` from step 2, create a map with all configurations. 

So right now I'm looking into how to create `ConstraintElement`s from Jandex index. There are a few things left that I'm thinking about at this point. They are marked as TODOs in the code. Here they are:

- is there a way to find out if an annotation is a constraint or not based on `AnnotationInstance` (Jandex class)
- how to convert `AnnotationInstance` to `Annotation` which is used to init `ConstraintDescriptorImpl` (for this one I think I'll try to do something similar to what is present in `MetaConstraintBuilder#buildMetaConstraint` with `AnnotationDescriptor` and `AnnotationFactory.create`

Also I've created a very simple `ConstrainedFieldJandexBuilderTest` that creates a jandex index form a bean to help write/debug all this jandex related code. 

So basically there's not much done for now :( . And I just wanted to have a place to discuss these kind of things. So I that I don't write a lot of code that will be wrong :)  Also one more question - is it ok to use Java 8 here or should we stay with 7 and ignore Streams and lambdas ?"	2016-11-30 10:37:49	0.0		0

3632	"> is there a way to find out if an annotation is a constraint or not based on AnnotationInstance (Jandex class)

You'd have to mimic what's done by `ConstraintHelper#isConstraintAnnotation()`. In the first iteration it should be enough to check for presence of the `Constraint` (meta) annotation. I've [just asked](http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/wildfly-dev/2016-December/005561.html) on wildfly-dev how to obtain meta-annotations, as it isn't clear from the API to me.

> how to convert AnnotationInstance to Annotation

We'd have to create an annotation proxy ourselve as we do it for XML-based configuration, too. See `org.hibernate.validator.internal.xml.MetaConstraintBuilder.buildMetaConstraint()`. It's not clear to me yet how to get the actual annotation type, but the answer may be provided with my question above on wildfly-dev."	2016-12-01 08:48:52	0.0		0

3636	"Hi @gunnarmorling and @gsmet 
here's an update on this task - I've finished with the builders for constraints and with the Jandex provider (in general). There are some things left to be done like get the index from somewhere and a few things from TODOs. I'll list them below:

- how the index should be received by provider ?
- change class search (as @gunnarmorling  mentioned `JandexHelper.getClassForName`). I've made a `JandexHelper` and it's methods nonstatic so the inside logic of `getClassForName`can be changed without changes to the method itself. I plan to look into this change next. 
- there seems to be a problem with Jandex index and parameter annotations. Please see test `ConstrainedFieldJandexBuilderTest.validAnnotationIsMissing`. It looks that Jandex is ignoring the `@Valid` annotation on a parameter. As a result - right now jandex metadata provider is throwing an  for cases when there's a type argument constraint for method parameter.
- there are a couple of methods like `isIndexable`, `isMap`, `isIterable` which are reusing `ReflectionHelper` methods, and I cannot see a way to mimic the logic using Jandex classes
- I haven't found any possibility to determine if annotation is a constraint or not based on Jandex classes, and I can see that for now there's no answer on wildfly-dev about it.
- in `GroupSequenceJandexHelper` there are two methods copied from `AnnotationMetaDataProvider` to obtain GroupSequenceProvider. Based on what is done in them - not sure if it'll be possible to do the same with jandex classes.
- don't see a way to filter out synthetic methods. 
- methods and constructors are returned in one collection and they don't have any differences (at least I didn't find any obvious one :) ). Constructor names are in such form `<init>` so I've added a logic to check if method name match this form then it's a constructor and we should look for a constructor rather that for a method in such case, when looking for a class member (reflection class)
- maybe `parameterNameProvider` can be improved to consume not only Method/Constructor ? But as` Executable executable` is already available at the point when `parameterNameProvider` is used - not sure if such change would be of any use.

3644	"> how the index should be received by provider?

This is something that is still undecided AFAIK. We need to see how we could get the index from WildFly.

I'm also wondering how we could test this Jandex stuff with all our tests (simply replacing the `AnnotationMetaDataProvider` to see how it behaves). It's really not easy considering you have to add the indexed classes one at a time.

If we can find a way to access the Jandex index of WildFly, we could run the TCK in container mode (-Dincontainer) to exercise the Jandex implementation.

I haven't taken a look at this. I think it can be left alone for now.

As mentioned, I don't have this issue at all. The test is passing here (I'm running the test in Eclipse if it matters).

Yeah, they are less used now due to changes Gunnar made recently but we still need them.

I think I'll rebase your patch on top of our recent work and see how it goes from there.

Let's keep them for now, we'll see if we need a parent class or something once we have a working experiment.

> don't see a way to filter out synthetic methods.

I did it the hard way. We'll need to open a Jandex issue so that they expose a method for it.

Yeah, I think it's as good as we can do for now. I moved it to its own method to be more clear. We will need to open a Jandex issue.

I fixed a couple of bugs, the provider is now working (I haven't inspected the result yet, just that there's some BeanConfiguration returned).

Note that one important change is that it does not scan all the classes of the index but just the constrained beans. I'm still unsure my implementation is sufficient, especially regarding class hierarchy.

Apart from that, I mainly cleaned up/reorganized the code. Here are a few general comments that might help you:
* always make your methods/fields private by default and make them protected only if needed
* put the methods only required by a subclass in the subclass itself, not in the parent
* no need for commenting everything: we document the API and what might be unclear but, for a private method, if you understand what it does just by reading its name and parameters, there's no need for javadoc

The only thing that I'd probably change is a return type of `JandexMetaDataProvider#findConstrainedBeans` from `Set` to `Stream`. But it's just my personal preference - I try to return `Streams` instead of collections wherever possible to omit returning modifiable collections (to prevent change of state of some bean enclosing that collection) and to prevent calls to `stream()` right after receiving a collection. I don't know if that would be more efficient than what we have right now but I'd probably would done something like this:

```
private static Stream<ClassInfo> findConstrainedBeans(IndexView indexView, List<DotName> constraintAnnotations) {
		// TODO HV-644: not sure this is totally accurate. I'm especially wondering how it will behave with subclasses and such.
		return constraintAnnotations.stream()
				.flatMap( constraintAnnotation -> indexView.getAnnotations( constraintAnnotation ).stream() )
				.map( ai -> ai.target() )
				.map( JandexMetaDataProvider::annotationInstanceToClassInfo )
				.distinct();
	}

Previously, the path would already have contained the node for the property of interest. Now we'll add that node when validating the constraint (via that new single validateMetaConstraint() method). Hence I'm removing it from the path so we don't end up with having it twice.

One could argue that the new approach is a bit less efficient (as we don't pre-select the relevant constraints), but I preferred that for the sake of less redundant code. We can look into optimizing things later on if needed.

Eventually we also should visit the constraints in order of their location. I.e. first all constraints on Foo#bar, then all on Foo#baz etc. Same for method parameters. This will allow us to do less appendNode()/removeNode() calls, i.e. not do it per constraint but per location. It also should help with that BVAL issue about ordered validation of constraints. I think we are getting to a better base for that.

I happens by virtue of the `surefire.argLine` and `surefire.argLine.extension` properties in the parent POM. There is a ""jdk-9"" profile which does it once for all sub-modules.

> And did you test locally (on a multi-core machine) that removing the 4 threads for the engine tests doesn't slow down the build?

Ah, seems I went a bit too far by trying to centralize the Surefire config. I've added this back.

I've also pushed another commit which makes the distribution build work. JavaDoc can be generated now on 9 without a build failure, but it looks broken. I reckon the style sheet was changed in Java 9 again. I'll leave that for another time (going to open an issue).

You can have a property name with a type argument constraint (e.g. `private Optional<@Min(1) Integer> myPositiveInteger`). But the code for method validation does its own path appending atm., it doesn't talk to `ConstraintLocation#appendNode()` (as it eventually should). Hence I think everything fits together as of this PR, but for sure it's in an intermediate state I plan to fix in follow-up PRs.

3797	"Hi @gunnarmorling I've read all the comments once more with a fresh head :) and found all the answers :)
I've added a warning for a case when interfaces used in group sequences are extending other interfaces. Added a check if the interface was not already used in a given group sequence already. And also done some clean up. It'll be great if you have a look when you have time. Thanks !

Also I was thinking more about these cycles and here's a case when I think we should produce an error, please let me know if I'm right :)

```
public static class Case7 {
        public interface Group1 {
        }

        public interface Group2 {
        }

        @GroupSequence(value = { Group1.class, Group4.class })
        public interface Group3 {
        }

        @GroupSequence(value = Group5.class)
        public interface Group4 {
        }

        @GroupSequence(value = { Group2.class, Group3.class })
        public interface Group5 {
        }
    }
```

In this case it'll be Group3 -> Group4 -> Group5 -> Group3. Is this a valid case ?

If so I'll need to update the code to go through such chains and find all interfaces. Sorry for all these questions but as I said I'm not very familiar with `GroupSequence`s :)

3801	"@marko-bekhta so I squashed and merged it with some additional cleanup (see https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/commit/a4d77518222c6822c2ba27b969e990d8dbaac5ed)

The main issue was that the following is perfectly valid:
```java
	/**
	 * Case 3: Hierarchy of groups
	 */
	public static class Case3 {
		public interface Group1 {
		}

		public interface Group2 extends Group1 {
		}

		public interface Group3 {
		}

		@GroupSequence(value = { Group2.class, Group3.class })
		public interface GroupSequence1 {
		}
	}
```

You can define hierarchy of groups. It's even one of the first examples in the specification: http://beanvalidation.org/latest-draft/spec/#constraintdeclarationvalidationprocess-groupsequence-groupinheritance .

What is not recommended is having a group sequence inheriting another interface so I changed it.

This misunderstanding had another consequence: you do not check that group inheritance creates cyclic definitions. I think you had something along those lines but checking group **sequences** inheritance once in your code and it was removed due to one of Gunnar's comment.

I did not have time to fix it so I would appreciate if you could do it.

I added a test at the bottom of InvalidGroupSequenceParameters which should throw an error (see the XXX).

We will release 5.4.0.Beta1 without this. It would be nice if you could fix it for CR1!

I created a specific issue to track it: https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-1180 .

Not sure we can do anything about it but this is probably the most common case of cyclic definition (it can of course be far more complicated to detect than this very simple example).

I don't think so. Let's keep it simple for the simple case and implement a class for further needs.

Yes, it would be nice to avoid it if we can.

+1, I think people needs to play with it in real life cases so that we can have useful feedback.

I guess from that perspective it might be ok, but it in the end BV has always been about declarative constraint mapping. Also, I find it odd that this is just working for simple cases. I would expect something which works for all cases. If not, I'd rather stick to what we have. Lambadas are the new generics and will get overused as generics did.

> So what's the idea really, provide an alternative/new constraint mapping API?

No, not a mapping API really. Rather a simplified way to implement a constraint's logic. It means to address user requests about making constraint implementation more light-weight.

> BV has always been about declarative constraint mapping. 

That wouldn't change, you'd still put your constraints in a declarative fashion.

> I would expect something which works for all cases

Yes, that's a question I have, too. I can see how we could have two overloaded methods or so. But it'd violate the ""provide one way to do a thing"" paradigm. In that light I kinda like to provide just a more light-weight approach for the most common case.

> Lambadas are the new generics and will get overused as generics did.

Hah, don't be that pessimistic. I believe in the good in people :)

I think we should add it in one way or another as experimental in HV 6 Alpha1 and look for feedback.

As said, I am not a big fan, especially if it just addresses one case.

> I think we should add it in one way or another as experimental in HV 6 Alpha1 and look for feedback.

I guess I could also see it as some experimental feature to explore it, but I don't think it is ready for BV.

- Addressing your remarks about the naming (in a way ""type"" could be applied to the descriptors, too, but I agree that ""class"" was too far off. Should be fixed everywhere now
- Adding a new annotation `@Incubating` (see [HV-1141](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/HV/issues/HV-1141)) and putting it to the new API members
- Adding docs

3973	"Taking a step back, there are two loose ends remaining:
- currently `validateType` only takes a `Class` object, but I think we should have one for `Type`, too. Because a user may wish to define an expression for `List<String>` instead of raw `List` (e.g. an equivalent to `SizeValidatorForCollection`)
- currently there is no way to declare a cross-parameter constraint using a Lambda expression (as the supported validation target(s) is controlled via an annotation on `ConstraintValidator` implementations)

I think we can do these two separately as there always is the current way of doing things.
